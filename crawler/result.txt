{"game": "NHL 13", "index": 2, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/nhl-13/xbox-360-128182", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/11/nhl-13-review", "review": "NHL fans are staring down the barrel of another lost season. Team owners and the players association stand at each other\u2019s throats for the second time in under a decade, and neither side seems willing to bend. For those of us obsessed with our respective hockey teams (go Isles!) and deeply saddened by the prospect of being forced to watch the NBA, NHL 13 may be the only place we can go for respite. And that\u2019s the first dose of good news loyal NHL fans have received in a while, because real hockey or not, NHL 13 is a fun, engaging and deep iteration of the world\u2019s best sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight off the bat, you\u2019ll notice some old fallbacks that you can jump right into. Play a scrimmage against the AI or a friend, start a season as any team you choose, or jump into the role of general manager and control your organization\u2019s destiny from the front office (and cozy sky box). The latter is a mode I spent a considerable amount of time with this year, bringing my beloved New York Islanders through a season and into an unexpected playoff berth. But in playing actual games on the ice as opposed to managing from the tranquility of a quiet, digital office, I came to enjoy the more overt tweaks and fixes EA made this year to make NHL 13 a more realistic experience.\n\nThis new dose of realism is derived from what EA calls \"True Performance Skating.\" Developer buzzterm aside, True Performance Skating marks a paradigm shift in the series by making the very act of skating less arcadey and more realistic. That means no more turning on a dime when barreling full speed towards the boards or shadowing a rushing player without sacrificing some modicum of control. What it does mean \u2013 easily understandable to anyone who grew up playing hockey \u2013 is that speed sacrifices control, and staying in control, in turn, sacrifices speed.\n\nSuch a system changes the way you\u2019ll play NHL 13, but you\u2019ll quickly adapt to this more realistic take. Hockey is a positional game \u2013 far more than casual fans understand it to be \u2013 and NHL 13 forces your hand by making you play it as such or reaping the consequences of failing to do so. Instead of playing the body while skating backwards into your own zone, you may opt to play it angularly, sacrificing an easy-to-save shot you know your goalie can handle instead of going in for the check, and likely missing in the process. Likewise, dumping-and-chasing won\u2019t be so much about a straight skate for the puck, but instead knowing when you\u2019re beat and subsequently letting off the gas a bit. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be left in the dust during the ensuing rush.\n\nA fundamental change like this works well, but it\u2019s also admittedly (if only mildly) confusing. NHL 13 isn\u2019t a simulation; it\u2019s an arcade-style hockey game supplemented with a heavy dose of realism. The opposing team almost never ices the puck or goes offside. Goalies regularly dish a covered puck back out to his defenders, hockey logic (and puck safety) be damned. And passes aren\u2019t only tape-to-tape; they\u2019re borderline magnetic. All of this is totally fine, but why emphasize more realistic skating \u2013 something at the core of the game \u2013 if the ancillary happenings around the rink aren\u2019t also addressed?\n\nStill, for this seeming lack of logic, EA has gone out of its way to change its NHL series in pretty dynamic ways considering the developer has under a year to iterate on last year\u2019s product. For instance, the AI has adjusted with new attention paid to realistic skating physics. The claim is that EA spent more time on AI this year than in the three years prior combined. Players can now skate backwards more easily, cradle and protect the puck with greater emphasis, and choose from a growing number of neutral zone tendencies and overall play styles. Goaltenders are smarter and less inclined to let up easy goals, like one-timers and wrap-arounds. They\u2019re also more acrobatic than they\u2019ve ever been \u2013 mirroring the real game we know and love \u2013 and can even move individual limbs while sprawling and diving, bringing a Hasek-esque like look and feel to NHL 13\u2019s armored netminders.\n\nThis emphasis on presentation oozes into every facet of NHL 13 and isn\u2019t only evident when actually playing. Slow load times and some menu stuttering aside, the game looks beautiful. Games are presented as they would be on NBC Sports, replete with the familiar commentary of Gary Thorne and Bill Clemente. Ambient sounds of the arena, the crowd and the on-ice product are all expertly executed as well, supplementing the game\u2019s high visual fidelity. Animations are occasionally awkward (as they appear to be in all EA Sports products), but that has more to do with the constant number-crunching behind the scenes than anything else. NHL 13 is a sight to behold, as several editors who have watched me play the game in the IGN offices brought it upon themselves to let me know. It plays virtually identically online and off, sacrificing none of the bells of whistles regardless of who you want to play with and where.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are NHL 13\u2019s two new modes. One mode, NHL Moments Live, allows gamers to relive moments from hockey\u2019s past, challenging them to recreate the exact scenario given whether it\u2019s a goal in overtime with a specific player, an overall point count in a certain amount of time, or anything else you can think of. With most of the moments coming from this past season (and with more promised to be downloadable if this currently stalled season ever gets off the ground), these are events even novice hockey fans will remember and appreciate.\n\nBut as great as this idea is in premise \u2013 and as fun as it is to partake in \u2013 there are some puzzling choices that take away from its realism. This is especially true when considering some old moments, such as Gretzky\u2019s big game against the Flyers in 1981 or Doug Gilmour\u2019s overtime heroics against the Blues in the 1993 playoffs. In those games, players are cast in the role as Gretzky or Gilmour but are surrounded by the current roster of the Oilers and Maple Leafs, respectively, while playing against the current rosters of their opponents. It simply doesn\u2019t make any sense and was disappointing when I was expecting to see some familiar faces accompanying these great players, not guys who were, at best, in diapers when some of these events took place.\n\nThe other new, notable mode is called GM Connected. EA claims that GM Mode in its NHL series is the most popular offline mode, and I can understand why. It\u2019s totally engrossing if you\u2019re a hockey nerd. EA decided to leverage this popularity by bringing it online and accommodating up to 750 players in a single league. That\u2019s no typo: each league can consist of up to 750 real people from around the world, acting as commissioner, general managers and even players.\n\nGM Connected is an ambitious and bold mode, but one that needs time in the wild to truly appreciate. Gearing up for GM Connected as I reviewed it amounted to checking static screens and waiting for other players to act (I eventually set it so my CPU will make all in-game decisions). This mode can be truly robust and pay off big in the end, but it\u2019s impossible to say right now with the limited amount of players online, and the equally limited interaction it therefore affords. In other words, the jury\u2019s still out on GM Connected, but it\u2019s something worth meddling with, especially if you enjoy offline GM mode.\n\nCombining GM Connected and NHL Moments Live with the aforementioned offline season, GM and scrimmage modes, as well as the ability to play in one-off playoffs, tournaments, practices and more, NHL 13 gives you incredible bang for your buck. And yes, you can even create your own pro once again this year (or even play as some well-known veterans from the NHL\u2019s past) and grind through the junior and minor leagues as you ascend towards NHL glory.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s so much to do in NHL 13. And in a year looking less and less likely to provide the real thing, NHL 13 proves a mighty promising distraction.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with NHL 13. And if you\u2019re a hockey junky like me, chances are you will, too. For a full-price title, gamers get so much more than mere roster and tuner updates (which come for free and with regularity, by the way). You also get robust online and offline modes that could potentially keep you busy for hundreds of hours.\n\nNHL 13 may have some problems and inconsistencies, but they barely detract from the quality product EA Canada has put out this year, one that may just keep you warm on those cold, dark nights when you should be watching the real thing but are forced to play it on your console of choice instead.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Here are five levels that have nothing to do with Sackboy. They're five games that star original characters, emulate old school space shooting, use touch, and redefine what people should expect from a LBP creation.\n\nThese are the most exciting levels for me. Everyone at IGN knew I was reviewing LittleBigPlanet PS Vita, but when they'd come over to look and see one of these levels, they didn't think it was the same game. When the LittleBigPlanet community gets its hands on the PS Vita version, amazing stuff is going to happen, and the PlayStation Vita is going to have a free App Store.\n\nThis calls out the biggest problem of LittleBigPlanet PS Vita -- creating stuff is still incredibly complicated. Of course, no one said creating games is easy, but this is my fourth LittleBigPlanet game, and I'm still stumped as to do some of the coolest stuff. I went through all of LBP Vita's 67 tutorials, but I still couldn't get my IGN text adventure off the ground.\n\nThis isn't a crippling problem as there are wikis, guides and a humongous community out there to help anyone willing to spend the time, but since 2008, LBP creation really hasn't changed that much on an instructional or intuitive front. The people who are great at it will continue to be great, and the casual creators like myself won't progress much. For future reference, I learn the best by seeing, so I'd love to look behind the curtain of the developer levels and see how those minds made their levels.\n\nStill, with the ability to tweak physics, water and more, the complicated create mode is bad for the casual creator and the best thing possible for the talented pros.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nLittleBigPlanet PS Vita is the definitive LittleBigPlanet game. It's everything you loved (or possibly didn't) from the past games boiled down into a package you can play anywhere at any time. You can collect prize bubbles while watching TV, download user-created levels at home and then play them on a plane, and sink the hours into learning create mode via 10-minute chunks at the Laundromat. Then, there's all the new stuff like touch controls, games that don't involve Sackboy, and the creation potential that could give you an endless supply of free games. \n\n Yes, the jumping is still floaty, the creation complicated and the load times a bit too long, but that doesn't stop LittleBigPlanet PS Vita from being an amazing experience.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Team owners and the players association stand at each other\u2019s throats for the second time in under a decade, and neither side seems willing to bend. For those of us obsessed with our respective hockey teams (go Isles!) and deeply saddened by the prospect of being forced to watch the NBA, NHL 13 may be the only place we can go for respite. And that\u2019s the first dose of good news loyal NHL fans have received in a while, because real hockey or not, NHL 13 is a fun, engaging and deep iteration of the world\u2019s best sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight off the bat, you\u2019ll notice some old fallbacks that you can jump right into. Play a scrimmage against the AI or a friend, start a season as any team you choose, or jump into the role of general manager and control your organization\u2019s destiny from the front office (and cozy sky box). The latter is a mode I spent a considerable amount of time with this year, bringing my beloved New York Islanders through a season and into an unexpected playoff berth. But in playing actual games on the ice as opposed to managing from the tranquility of a quiet, digital office, I came to enjoy the more overt tweaks and fixes EA made this year to make NHL 13 a more realistic experience.\n\nThis new dose of realism is derived from what EA calls \"True Performance Skating.\" Developer buzzterm aside, True Performance Skating marks a paradigm shift in the series by making the very act of skating less arcadey and more realistic. That means no more turning on a dime when barreling full speed towards the boards or shadowing a rushing player without sacrificing some modicum of control. What it does mean \u2013 easily understandable to anyone who grew up playing hockey \u2013 is that speed sacrifices control, and staying in control, in turn, sacrifices speed.\n\nSuch a system changes the way you\u2019ll play NHL 13, but you\u2019ll quickly adapt to this more realistic take. Hockey is a positional game \u2013 far more than casual fans understand it to be \u2013 and NHL 13 forces your hand by making you play it as such or reaping the consequences of failing to do so. Instead of playing the body while skating backwards into your own zone, you may opt to play it angularly, sacrificing an easy-to-save shot you know your goalie can handle instead of going in for the check, and likely missing in the process. Likewise, dumping-and-chasing won\u2019t be so much about a straight skate for the puck, but instead knowing when you\u2019re beat and subsequently letting off the gas a bit. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be left in the dust during the ensuing rush.\n\nA fundamental change like this works well, but it\u2019s also admittedly (if only mildly) confusing. NHL 13 isn\u2019t a simulation; it\u2019s an arcade-style hockey game supplemented with a heavy dose of realism. The opposing team almost never ices the puck or goes offside. Goalies regularly dish a covered puck back out to his defenders, hockey logic (and puck safety) be damned. And passes aren\u2019t only tape-to-tape; they\u2019re borderline magnetic. All of this is totally fine, but why emphasize more realistic skating \u2013 something at the core of the game \u2013 if the ancillary happenings around the rink aren\u2019t also addressed?\n\nStill, for this seeming lack of logic, EA has gone out of its way to change its NHL series in pretty dynamic ways considering the developer has under a year to iterate on last year\u2019s product. For instance, the AI has adjusted with new attention paid to realistic skating physics. The claim is that EA spent more time on AI this year than in the three years prior combined. Players can now skate backwards more easily, cradle and protect the puck with greater emphasis, and choose from a growing number of neutral zone tendencies and overall play styles. Goaltenders are smarter and less inclined to let up easy goals, like one-timers and wrap-arounds. They\u2019re also more acrobatic than they\u2019ve ever been \u2013 mirroring the real game we know and love \u2013 and can even move individual limbs while sprawling and diving, bringing a Hasek-esque like look and feel to NHL 13\u2019s armored netminders.\n\nThis emphasis on presentation oozes into every facet of NHL 13 and isn\u2019t only evident when actually playing. Slow load times and some menu stuttering aside, the game looks beautiful. Games are presented as they would be on NBC Sports, replete with the familiar commentary of Gary Thorne and Bill Clemente. Ambient sounds of the arena, the crowd and the on-ice product are all expertly executed as well, supplementing the game\u2019s high visual fidelity. Animations are occasionally awkward (as they appear to be in all EA Sports products), but that has more to do with the constant number-crunching behind the scenes than anything else. NHL 13 is a sight to behold, as several editors who have watched me play the game in the IGN offices brought it upon themselves to let me know. It plays virtually identically online and off, sacrificing none of the bells of whistles regardless of who you want to play with and where.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are NHL 13\u2019s two new modes. One mode, NHL Moments Live, allows gamers to relive moments from hockey\u2019s past, challenging them to recreate the exact scenario given whether it\u2019s a goal in overtime with a specific player, an overall point count in a certain amount of time, or anything else you can think of. With most of the moments coming from this past season (and with more promised to be downloadable if this currently stalled season ever gets off the ground), these are events even novice hockey fans will remember and appreciate.\n\nBut as great as this idea is in premise \u2013 and as fun as it is to partake in \u2013 there are some puzzling choices that take away from its realism. This is especially true when considering some old moments, such as Gretzky\u2019s big game against the Flyers in 1981 or Doug Gilmour\u2019s overtime heroics against the Blues in the 1993 playoffs. In those games, players are cast in the role as Gretzky or Gilmour but are surrounded by the current roster of the Oilers and Maple Leafs, respectively, while playing against the current rosters of their opponents. It simply doesn\u2019t make any sense and was disappointing when I was expecting to see some familiar faces accompanying these great players, not guys who were, at best, in diapers when some of these events took place.\n\nThe other new, notable mode is called GM Connected. EA claims that GM Mode in its NHL series is the most popular offline mode, and I can understand why. It\u2019s totally engrossing if you\u2019re a hockey nerd. EA decided to leverage this popularity by bringing it online and accommodating up to 750 players in a single league. That\u2019s no typo: each league can consist of up to 750 real people from around the world, acting as commissioner, general managers and even players.\n\nGM Connected is an ambitious and bold mode, but one that needs time in the wild to truly appreciate. Gearing up for GM Connected as I reviewed it amounted to checking static screens and waiting for other players to act (I eventually set it so my CPU will make all in-game decisions). This mode can be truly robust and pay off big in the end, but it\u2019s impossible to say right now with the limited amount of players online, and the equally limited interaction it therefore affords. In other words, the jury\u2019s still out on GM Connected, but it\u2019s something worth meddling with, especially if you enjoy offline GM mode.\n\nCombining GM Connected and NHL Moments Live with the aforementioned offline season, GM and scrimmage modes, as well as the ability to play in one-off playoffs, tournaments, practices and more, NHL 13 gives you incredible bang for your buck. And yes, you can even create your own pro once again this year (or even play as some well-known veterans from the NHL\u2019s past) and grind through the junior and minor leagues as you ascend towards NHL glory.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s so much to do in NHL 13. And in a year looking less and less likely to provide the real thing, NHL 13 proves a mighty promising distraction.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with NHL 13. And if you\u2019re a hockey junky like me, chances are you will, too. For a full-price title, gamers get so much more than mere roster and tuner updates (which come for free and with regularity, by the way). You also get robust online and offline modes that could potentially keep you busy for hundreds of hours.\n\nNHL 13 may have some problems and inconsistencies, but they barely detract from the quality product EA Canada has put out this year, one that may just keep you warm on those cold, dark nights when you should be watching the real thing but are forced to play it on your console of choice instead.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

{"game": "Total War Battles: Shogun", "index": 4, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/total-war-battles-shogun/mac-142565", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/12/total-war-battles-shogun-review", "review": "The thought of taking the Total War experience and cramming it into a downloadable title must have seemed a little like trying to condense a whale into a single sushi roll, but Creative Assembly managed to somewhat successfully do it for iOS and Android early this year with Total War Battles: Shogun. Now it\u2019s out for the PC on Steam, revealing an increasingly common trend for mobile games to work their way to the PC instead of the other way around. Make no mistake --Total War Battles: Shogun has very little in common with the mainstream entries of the franchise, but it does a commendable, if qualified, job of playing wakizashi to Shogun 2\u2019s katana.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking this isn't Total War at first glance. Total War Battles: Shogun basically comes down to constructing a base on the left side of the screen and sending out various soldiers in a roughly straight line to wipe out the general on the right. It never really gets more complex aside from considering each unit\u2019s abilities, and thus it shares more in common with Plants vs. Zombies than last year\u2019s masterful Shogun 2. It's a good decision for the format, for the most part. It embraces players who've been frightened away by the main series' boggling cascades of statistics by even stripping combat units of health bars, and it sweeps aside the daunting blank slate of Total Wars' open battlefields for structured hexagonal grids.\n\nIndeed, it's not so much of a war simulator as a puzzle. That emphasis reveals itself from the moment you start setting down your buildings for resources and troop production, as each possesses a unique footprint that must be paired with another for maximum efficiency within a limited space. Thus your mines and marketplace need to be close to your headquarters (as well as positioned to take advantage of any resource deposit bonuses), and you need to position your monasteries away from the mines because the monk units can\u2019t meditate with all that racket going on. Botch up the placement, though, and you'll be forced to finish the match without some of the more advanced buildings since you don't have anywhere to put them. It's generally a nice touch that helps season the entire experience with a hefty dose of strategy (but also a dash of frustration), particularly since you'll need to get much of this puzzling out of the way before the enemy's troops start marching into view.\n\nBut even if you do fall behind, Shogun offers a decent amount of freedom for troop placement and allows you to worm your way out of tight situations with its intuitive rock, paper, scissors combat system. Archers soften up incoming infantrymen, for instance, pikemen counter incoming cavalry, and riflemen make quick work of archers. The main challenge springs from their inability to retreat from their relentless forward march (a nod to the Japanese code of Bushido, we\u2019re told), so if you\u2019ve been overbold in rushing your troops to the opposing side, it\u2019s possible for the enemy to spawn troops behind your main force and march on your general with impunity. Further nods to strategy arise from a timer that keeps troops from switching to higher or lower rows on the grid to a minimum, and numerous chunks of terrain allow you to take advantage of bottlenecks and the like. In time, these miniature struggles become so challenging that they sweep away most doubts that Shogun is enjoyable as a strategy game in its own right.\n\nOne of Shogun's greatest strengths is that these little battles are worth watching, which plays nicely into Creative Assembly's decision to strip units of any visible statistics. Troops deploy in groups of four or less on the grid, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a lone surviving ronin doesn\u2019t have a chance against four incoming pikemen. Just when you\u2019re sure your little swordsman\u2019s going to die, he\u2019ll thrust forward and take out one of the pikemen with a direct stab to the chest. He\u2019ll then whittle one of the others to death with a few slashes before the others finally kill him, thus rendering them a lesser threat than they were. It\u2019s enough to add a welcome dash of unpredictability to every encounter, which makes the gameplay a little more challenging than its basic mechanics would imply. Even better, this all takes place against the backdrop of a richly stylized Japanese landscape, and in its best moments, it\u2019s reminiscent of playing in a colorful ukiyo-e woodcut.\n\nThere\u2019s also a stereotypical story about clan betrayal and blackmail wedged in between the 23 missions of the campaign, and while it benefits from some competent voice work, it never achieves any greater meaning aside from justifying the arrival of a new unit or weapon. Still, the pacing is impeccable for the most part, allowing you to master the strengths and weaknesses of each unit and to improve your skills at laying out your buildings before the battles become punishingly difficult about halfway through. You'll find yourself better prepared for these later missions if you tackle the numerous side missions for extra experience points, but you'll also discover that they don't cover everything if you play long enough. For that, you\u2019ll eventually have to head to the cash shop, which has experience packages ranging from $.49 to $9.99. The side themselves are usually enjoyable affair, focused as they are on specific objectives such as building a set amount of buildings or killing a certain number of enemies, but many suffer from plodding pacing and exceptionally challenging situations that seem designed to nudge you to throw in the towel and fork out some more cash.\n\nUnfortunately, its mobile pedigree also shows all too well, particularly in Shogun\u2019s odd insistence on holding down the left mouse button on a unit\u2019s icon for a couple of seconds before a tooltip pops up with some information. On the PC, a simple right click or a mouse over would have sufficed. It also suffers from the lack of any kind of online multiplayer mode, which seems all but unthinkable for an entry in the Total War franchise, and more so since the iPad version at least had a local multiplayer option. Instead, its replay value rests on six short skirmish maps and their three difficulty settings, which seems adequate for a mobile release but not for the PC.\n\nTotal War Battles: Shogun might be an entirely different game from to its legendarily robust relatives, but it nevertheless manages to provide some semblance of the depth and strategy the series is known for while extending an open hand to newcomers. Yet that was also true of the mobile version, too, and considering this release's omission of a multiplayer mode and its puzzling reluctance to fully adapt touchscreen controls for the PC port, this version limps a few  steps behind. That's not to say that there's not plenty of fun in store here, though, and its story, 10-hour campaign, and numerous challenges combine to justify its $7.99 price tag despite its comparative shortcomings.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

How about when failure meant having to replay an entire level? It\u2019s a good thing those days are over \u2013 and it\u2019s too bad Double Dragon: Neon doesn\u2019t realize it.\n\nDouble Dragon: Neon is the embodiment of what\u2019s wrong with HD remakes. It\u2019s afraid to let go of the \u201880s altar it worships at, even if it means cramming a crummy, archaic experience down players\u2019 throats. Rather than remind players what they loved about the series, Neon reminds them why the arcade is dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch to its disadvantage, Neon never sets out to be anything other than Double Dragon. Yes, it adds new mechanics like unlockable special moves and shops for replenishing lost lives, as well as 3D characters, but at its core this is a loyal retro remake. Everything around it is superfluous because none of those features contribute anything to Neon\u2019s benefit. There\u2019s a laundry list of issues in Double Dragon that don\u2019t sit well decades later, and Neon retains all of them.\n\nThe additional stages help fill out the original game\u2019s 30-minute length, but only by about another 30 minutes, so you\u2019re paying ten bucks for an hour of gameplay. In those new levels you\u2019ll encounter inept platforming segments, which don\u2019t mesh well with Neon\u2019s slow, cumbersome characters. You\u2019ll also suffer through frustrating enemy encounters that aim for you to fail, only to have to repeat an entire scenario from the start. In addition, the finicky combat demands precision Neon can\u2019t achieve, so expect to punch a lot of dead air instead of bad guys when you\u2019re not on the exact same plane.\n\nThis dedication to bygone design philosophies wounds Double Dragon: Neon because it compromises quality for the sake of nostalgia. Granted, it does a bang-up job of nailing the goofy, fun tone of the \u201880s, and exaggerating it where necessary, but if you\u2019re not obsessed with the culture of the time, the cheesy one-liners, outdated styles, and constant references to old action movies will be completely lost on you. Even then, the only thing Double Dragon: Neon does exceptionally well in this respect is music. The shredding guitar solos, upbeat synth melodies, and pop-fueled power-ballads are crafted with expert mockery .

Crowds crush together, jumping around and blasting spells and swinging huge weapons. You join in, and though all possibility for any real coordination is lost in the frenzy, a sense of community, of belonging, solidifies as everyone strives to destroy a shared target. In Guild Wars 2, ArenaNet builds these events into every single zone, teasing you to explore by instilling a sense that despite Tyria\u2019s colossal size, another surprise isn\u2019t far away.\n\nThere\u2019s no global player versus player combat in main zones where you\u2019ll level up to the 80 cap. Like Turbine\u2019s The Lord of the Rings Online, Guild Wars 2 establishes a friendly, inviting atmosphere by setting everyone on the same path to vanquish a seemingly invincible evil, and effectively removes many of the genre\u2019s tedious restrictions on cooperation. There are no long lines to wait in, no cliques of high level players lording their seniority over the rest, no wristbands required to see the most interesting stuff, everyone can easily take part in the cyclical, world-spanning party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who\u2019s played Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning and Rift should be familiar with the idea of public questing, which ArenaNet utilizes to achieve spectacular effects in Guild Wars 2. More than serving as simply another bit of busywork, the events fill out the fiction of each zone, requiring those present to do things like aid Asuran scientists in a fight against colossal fiery destroyers in a volcano\u2019s superheated stomach or defend a drowsy mountainside shack from rampaging steam-powered creatures. Events are often linked, so what begins as a simple kill quest could eventually turn into a full-on centaur invasion of an otherwise peaceful township, making each task more exciting because it could be lead to some sinister and undiscovered threat.\n\nThese events serve as Guild Wars 2\u2019s primary form of quests. They activate in every zone regularly, and at low levels involve kill, escort or collection tasks. While the initial event goals may not be especially memorable, they effectively bind your cause to everyone else\u2019s and set the tone for the rest of the experience. There are no hoops to jump through to participate in an event. You don\u2019t have to group up and make sure everyone\u2019s on the same step. There\u2019s no waiting around for a group that\u2019s already engaged the enemy to finish up so you can beat up the mob when it respawns. Instead, when something happens, you just show up and play.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nNeed help in Guild Wars 2? Check out IGN's wiki.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nIn higher level zones the events become more complex in nature, until, in the level 70 through 80 areas, you get zone-wide stories culminating in thrilling climactic encounters in ominous coral-lined battlegrounds. Even before reaching those, the outcomes of events beyond the starting zones gain significance as entire in-game structures can be destroyed and rebuilt, and waypoint travel through contested territory temporarily blocked. These events never seem to cease, making Tyria feel chaotic and vaguely plausible, a place where the forces of good and evil don\u2019t simply wait around for your permission to act.\n\nYou get experience and virtual currency for partaking in these roving battle parties regardless of which stage you happened to walk in at. By stripping away restrictions to join and generously blanketing all involved with rewards, ArenaNet provides ample motivation to bunch up and share the storytelling experience as NPCs shout orders and crack jokes while monsters attack. It brings the whole world together so naturally that there\u2019s rarely a lonely moment, and anytime the in-game interface lights up with notifications and you see a big cluster of players, it\u2019s always a joyous event.\n\nOne drawback of this system is, though the social experience and spectacle of the bigger event chains can be exhilarating, the gameplay doesn\u2019t really match up. After running an event multiple times and learning the story and its mechanics, the initial sense of wonder melts away, and most are left doing the same old dull skill rotations over and over. Often such a big crowd gathers at an event that it\u2019s easy to get lost in in the fireworks of spell effects and slashing of giant weapons, making it difficult to tell what effect you\u2019re really having in the overall battle. As social storytelling devices the events are brilliant, but in making the experience accessible to all, sophisticated gameplay is sacrificed.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nStill need help in Guild Wars 2? You can also check out IGN's iOS app.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nAside from events, the world of Tyria is dotted with quest givers represented by hearts on the world map, and the tasks they offer are more standard MMO fare. There\u2019s still no quest log associated with these NPCs; their demands can be met by simply standing near them and completing specific tasks like rousing lazy workers, mending fences, killing enemies and retrieving artifacts. Compared to the hyperactive pageantry of the event system, the gameplay of the heart tasks feels tedious, despite ArenaNet\u2019s frequent implementation of alternate skill bars to add variety. They\u2019re something to do instead of something worth doing, which even ArenaNet appears to recognize because heart tasks appear nowhere in the post-level 70 zones.\n\nStill, event chains and heart tasks are often built to overlap, so not too much time must be spend taking care of Guild Wars 2\u2019s chores. Better yet, nearly everything in Guild Wars 2 awards experience, from mining to jumping up the sides of mountains to reach vista points to leveling your crafting skills by discovering recipes for stuffed mushrooms and cheese pizza. If someone else in the world is already attacking an enemy, you can attack too and still claim loot and experience. If someone is already mining ore, that doesn\u2019t prevent you from mining it as well. So not only are other players barred from attacking and killing you in the PvE world, they\u2019re prevented from inconveniencing you, which casts off a significant amount of unnecessary tension usually associated with MMO play. You\u2019re constantly showered in positive reinforcement, given items or experience or currency or all three for nearly everything, and yet it never seems excessive to the point where the rewards lose their significance.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

How about when failure meant having to replay an entire level? It\u2019s a good thing those days are over \u2013 and it\u2019s too bad Double Dragon: Neon doesn\u2019t realize it.\n\nDouble Dragon: Neon is the embodiment of what\u2019s wrong with HD remakes. It\u2019s afraid to let go of the \u201880s altar it worships at, even if it means cramming a crummy, archaic experience down players\u2019 throats. Rather than remind players what they loved about the series, Neon reminds them why the arcade is dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch to its disadvantage, Neon never sets out to be anything other than Double Dragon. Yes, it adds new mechanics like unlockable special moves and shops for replenishing lost lives, as well as 3D characters, but at its core this is a loyal retro remake. Everything around it is superfluous because none of those features contribute anything to Neon\u2019s benefit. There\u2019s a laundry list of issues in Double Dragon that don\u2019t sit well decades later, and Neon retains all of them.\n\nThe additional stages help fill out the original game\u2019s 30-minute length, but only by about another 30 minutes, so you\u2019re paying ten bucks for an hour of gameplay. In those new levels you\u2019ll encounter inept platforming segments, which don\u2019t mesh well with Neon\u2019s slow, cumbersome characters. You\u2019ll also suffer through frustrating enemy encounters that aim for you to fail, only to have to repeat an entire scenario from the start. In addition, the finicky combat demands precision Neon can\u2019t achieve, so expect to punch a lot of dead air instead of bad guys when you\u2019re not on the exact same plane.\n\nThis dedication to bygone design philosophies wounds Double Dragon: Neon because it compromises quality for the sake of nostalgia. Granted, it does a bang-up job of nailing the goofy, fun tone of the \u201880s, and exaggerating it where necessary, but if you\u2019re not obsessed with the culture of the time, the cheesy one-liners, outdated styles, and constant references to old action movies will be completely lost on you. Even then, the only thing Double Dragon: Neon does exceptionally well in this respect is music. The shredding guitar solos, upbeat synth melodies, and pop-fueled power-ballads are crafted with expert mockery . The parodies are so on-point, though, that a few of them are totally listenable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun tunes can\u2019t salvage the clunky combat and plodding pace of Double Dragon: Neon, of course, especially in the face of even more unforgivable issues. During a late-game boss fight, I died and my co-op partner killed a behemoth tank. By virtue of having to throw explosives at its close-range weak spot, he died as well. Neon didn\u2019t restart the level or advance us, so we had to reboot the console and start the entire stage again. Neon\u2019s design is even worse if you\u2019re playing alone.

{"game": "Total War Battles: Shogun", "index": 8, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/total-war-battles-shogun/pc-142564", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/12/total-war-battles-shogun-review", "review": "The thought of taking the Total War experience and cramming it into a downloadable title must have seemed a little like trying to condense a whale into a single sushi roll, but Creative Assembly managed to somewhat successfully do it for iOS and Android early this year with Total War Battles: Shogun. Now it\u2019s out for the PC on Steam, revealing an increasingly common trend for mobile games to work their way to the PC instead of the other way around. Make no mistake --Total War Battles: Shogun has very little in common with the mainstream entries of the franchise, but it does a commendable, if qualified, job of playing wakizashi to Shogun 2\u2019s katana.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking this isn't Total War at first glance. Total War Battles: Shogun basically comes down to constructing a base on the left side of the screen and sending out various soldiers in a roughly straight line to wipe out the general on the right. It never really gets more complex aside from considering each unit\u2019s abilities, and thus it shares more in common with Plants vs. Zombies than last year\u2019s masterful Shogun 2. It's a good decision for the format, for the most part. It embraces players who've been frightened away by the main series' boggling cascades of statistics by even stripping combat units of health bars, and it sweeps aside the daunting blank slate of Total Wars' open battlefields for structured hexagonal grids.\n\nIndeed, it's not so much of a war simulator as a puzzle. That emphasis reveals itself from the moment you start setting down your buildings for resources and troop production, as each possesses a unique footprint that must be paired with another for maximum efficiency within a limited space. Thus your mines and marketplace need to be close to your headquarters (as well as positioned to take advantage of any resource deposit bonuses), and you need to position your monasteries away from the mines because the monk units can\u2019t meditate with all that racket going on. Botch up the placement, though, and you'll be forced to finish the match without some of the more advanced buildings since you don't have anywhere to put them. It's generally a nice touch that helps season the entire experience with a hefty dose of strategy (but also a dash of frustration), particularly since you'll need to get much of this puzzling out of the way before the enemy's troops start marching into view.\n\nBut even if you do fall behind, Shogun offers a decent amount of freedom for troop placement and allows you to worm your way out of tight situations with its intuitive rock, paper, scissors combat system. Archers soften up incoming infantrymen, for instance, pikemen counter incoming cavalry, and riflemen make quick work of archers. The main challenge springs from their inability to retreat from their relentless forward march (a nod to the Japanese code of Bushido, we\u2019re told), so if you\u2019ve been overbold in rushing your troops to the opposing side, it\u2019s possible for the enemy to spawn troops behind your main force and march on your general with impunity. Further nods to strategy arise from a timer that keeps troops from switching to higher or lower rows on the grid to a minimum, and numerous chunks of terrain allow you to take advantage of bottlenecks and the like. In time, these miniature struggles become so challenging that they sweep away most doubts that Shogun is enjoyable as a strategy game in its own right.\n\nOne of Shogun's greatest strengths is that these little battles are worth watching, which plays nicely into Creative Assembly's decision to strip units of any visible statistics. Troops deploy in groups of four or less on the grid, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a lone surviving ronin doesn\u2019t have a chance against four incoming pikemen. Just when you\u2019re sure your little swordsman\u2019s going to die, he\u2019ll thrust forward and take out one of the pikemen with a direct stab to the chest. He\u2019ll then whittle one of the others to death with a few slashes before the others finally kill him, thus rendering them a lesser threat than they were. It\u2019s enough to add a welcome dash of unpredictability to every encounter, which makes the gameplay a little more challenging than its basic mechanics would imply. Even better, this all takes place against the backdrop of a richly stylized Japanese landscape, and in its best moments, it\u2019s reminiscent of playing in a colorful ukiyo-e woodcut.\n\nThere\u2019s also a stereotypical story about clan betrayal and blackmail wedged in between the 23 missions of the campaign, and while it benefits from some competent voice work, it never achieves any greater meaning aside from justifying the arrival of a new unit or weapon. Still, the pacing is impeccable for the most part, allowing you to master the strengths and weaknesses of each unit and to improve your skills at laying out your buildings before the battles become punishingly difficult about halfway through. You'll find yourself better prepared for these later missions if you tackle the numerous side missions for extra experience points, but you'll also discover that they don't cover everything if you play long enough. For that, you\u2019ll eventually have to head to the cash shop, which has experience packages ranging from $.49 to $9.99. The side themselves are usually enjoyable affair, focused as they are on specific objectives such as building a set amount of buildings or killing a certain number of enemies, but many suffer from plodding pacing and exceptionally challenging situations that seem designed to nudge you to throw in the towel and fork out some more cash.\n\nUnfortunately, its mobile pedigree also shows all too well, particularly in Shogun\u2019s odd insistence on holding down the left mouse button on a unit\u2019s icon for a couple of seconds before a tooltip pops up with some information. On the PC, a simple right click or a mouse over would have sufficed. It also suffers from the lack of any kind of online multiplayer mode, which seems all but unthinkable for an entry in the Total War franchise, and more so since the iPad version at least had a local multiplayer option. Instead, its replay value rests on six short skirmish maps and their three difficulty settings, which seems adequate for a mobile release but not for the PC.\n\nTotal War Battles: Shogun might be an entirely different game from to its legendarily robust relatives, but it nevertheless manages to provide some semblance of the depth and strategy the series is known for while extending an open hand to newcomers. Yet that was also true of the mobile version, too, and considering this release's omission of a multiplayer mode and its puzzling reluctance to fully adapt touchscreen controls for the PC port, this version limps a few  steps behind. That's not to say that there's not plenty of fun in store here, though, and its story, 10-hour campaign, and numerous challenges combine to justify its $7.99 price tag despite its comparative shortcomings.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

It wants you to spend countless hours mastering its timing, tooling around with its dozen of characters, and making it your own. There\u2019s a slight problem, though: It doesn\u2019t make any of that terribly easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers new to the Tekken universe will want to make their way directly to the Fight Lab to learn the Tekken Tag Tournament 2 basics. Acting as a tutorial of sorts (and a replacement to the traditional Story Mode), Fight Lab drops you into the role of the Combot, a creation of Violet Industries that can learn any Tekken fighter\u2019s techniques and use them in training exercises. Each level of the Fight Lab mini-campaign is designed to teach the player how to pull off some of the Tag 2-specific fighting maneuvers like Binds or Tag Assaults. What\u2019s more, it does it in a charming and often absurd manner, with levels filled with Power Ranger-looking combatants that toss pizzas and turn your head into a pig. Hell, one of the chapter bosses is a fat Ryu from Street Fighter. Silliness abounds.\n\nTheoretically, a tutorial to teach newcomers how to get their martial arts on is a great idea. Fighting games are constantly struggling to bring new players into the fold, and a step-by-step set of interactive instructions could be a great way to do that. Problem is, Fight Lab teaches via the \u201ctrial by fire\u201d method. Can\u2019t regularly figure out the timing of the Bind into Team Assault? Too bad, you\u2019re going to keep attempting it until you do. For those who already have experience with fighters, it\u2019s a solid way to learn a few of Tekken\u2019s intricacies. However, it is too demanding to serve as a proper newbie-friendly experience.\n\nOf course, once you get into the fighting itself, you\u2019ll realize that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is still Tekken. It\u2019s still got all the perfectly solid fighting mechanics that you\u2019ve come to know and love since the series\u2019 inception in 1994. You\u2019ll still be working on your air juggles, your one-two(-three-four-five-six) punches, your precision blocking, and throw breaks.

By bringing in your tagged out teammate while your opponent is in the air, you can lay down ridiculous air juggling combos that seemingly go on for minutes at a time. With dozens of characters playable, the Tag Assault combinations are damn near endless. I\u2019ve got my apprehensions about how well Tag 2 is balanced, but all that will only shake out once it\u2019s being played on a truly competitive level.\n\nOptions are plentiful for those who decide to dedicate their fighting time to Tag 2. You\u2019ve got your standard versus modes, your practice mode that allows for recording and uploading videos, and your Survival Mode. The netcode isn\u2019t perfect, as I experienced a few slowdowns here and there, but they were few and far between. Those looking for a lengthy online experience will definitely run into hiccups, but hopefully the more egregious moments will be culled out by future patches.\n\nBut perhaps the most fun I had with Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was with the Pair Play mode. Designed for four players, it allows each person to take the role of one character each, to be tagged in and out at their leisure. The end result is a group of folks screaming and shouting and laughing all at once while the party chaos ensues on screen.

The cosmetic items largely don\u2019t change the way that fighters do their thing, but the options are great for dedicated players that want to make their favorite characters their own.\n\nWith its gigantic roster, in-depth character customization options, and breadth of modes, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. That is, if you make it past some of the more frustrating and impenetrable aspects of the Tekken universe. As a way into the genre, it could certainly do a heck of a lot better. But once you\u2019re in, it\u2019s a perfectly solid experience in which brawling fans will find a lot to love.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

In a move that\u2019s simultaneously refreshing and familiar, Mark of the Ninja is a 2D stealth adventure that, at first glance, looks a bit Metroidvania-esque. You\u2019ll jump and grapple-hook your way around mostly linear levels (though occasional path choices and backtracking occur), clinging to walls and ceilings, hiding in floor grates, and pressing B to duck behind potted plants or in doorways \u2013 all in the name of avoiding detection.\n\nYou begin with only these most basic of moves, but as you finish levels and secondary objectives within each mission (such as completing an area without raising an alarm), you\u2019ll earn medals redeemable for new moves that significantly liven up the game and open up your options. For instance, there\u2019s a taunt that lets you string-up your kills in order to terrorize the other guards, a la Batman. Or the not-so-subtle nod to Metal Gear Solid: the cardboard box. Seeing your black-clad hero reach out from underneath the simple disguise, grab a victim, and drag him back under the box while his buddies ignorantly walk by is as sadistically rewarding as it is hilarious.\n\nIf you get found out, especially by a dog, you&#Array;re in trouble.\n\nMore seriously laudable is Ninja\u2019s scoring system. While many stealth games claim you can play them how you want (read: lethally or non-lethally), this one actually rewards you with medal-earning XP either way. If you knife every fool, you\u2019ll earn some points. Hide their bodies when you\u2019re done and you\u2019ll net more. Terrorize them and you\u2019ll bag yet more. Or score plenty of points just for sneaking by the bad guys undetected. This is complemented by additional play styles that become available as you go, like \u201cWay of the Ninja.\u201d This removes your sword \u2013 thereby making it nearly impossible to kill anyone \u2013 but gives you extra distraction tools, such as the aforementioned cardboard box, firecrackers, terror darts, etc. It wholly changes the way the game is played, akin to watching a different director\u2019s cut of your favorite movie.\n\nAll of these added perks culminate in the highly recommended New Game Plus mode, in which the enemies get tougher but you\u2019ve got access to your full arsenal of unlocked goodies right from the first stage.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to replay the 6-8 hour campaign, though probably not for the story (but oh, those drool-inducing animated cutscenes!). The plot starts simple and never really evolves, though it\u2019s just engaging enough to make you stop and think when you reach its forked ending. Unfortunately, neither choice at the campaign\u2019s climax pays off with a revelation or additional backstory. Or anything, really.\n\nTheatricality and deception are powerful tools...\n\nNinja\u2019s only other crimes are, first, that its gorgeous animations aren\u2019t showcased enough; there simply isn\u2019t enough variety in the kills. Nearly every fatal scene shows you slicing a bad guy at the neck or through the belly. Even the gameplay side of this could be fresher \u2013 you\u2019re always pressing X and a cardinal direction for every fatal blow. We would\u2019ve loved to have seen (literally, with this gorgeous art style) more choice in ways to off your enemies.\n\nAnd second, Ninja loses its way a bit around two-thirds of way through the game with a mildly frustrating stage packed with platforming puzzles. It doesn\u2019t last too long, but it is the clear weak point of the campaign. Also, a quick note for PC players: though Mark of the Ninja is playable using traditional WASD+mouse first-person shooter-style controls, it's quite awkward here. I highly, highly recommend using an Xbox gamepad for the smoothest-steering Ninja experience possible.\n\nBegone, pesky light bulb!\n\nStill, forget about being among the cream of the downloadable game crop \u2013 that much is a given.

Sadly, not being born in Japan hundreds of years ago got in the way of that dream. But in Way of the Samurai 4, players can find out how they would have fared walking the world as a lone samurai warrior. Way of the Samurai 4 is a download-only open world action game for the PlayStation Network that allows the player to explore their morality or dark desires in the uncommon setting of a small Japanese village under constant conflict.\n\nCaught between a militant government, xenophobic nationalists and a foreign body eager for expansion, you take on the role of a Japanese ronin in the year 1853. As a nameless and masterless samurai, you journey into a small township where these three factions stand at odds. It\u2019s the decisions that you make, the missions you accept and the success you have that determine your samurai\u2019s fate.\n\nRight off the bat, you get dropped into a series of combat scenarios and are quickly forced to make a choice about the path your character will take. Everything seems cut and dry as you\u2019re presented with the opportunity to save a small and delicate looking young woman from a gang of rebels. The woman is a British ambassador who has come to the small town in hopes of establishing a trade relationship while the rebels are trying to repel the outsiders from influencing their home. You can be the \"good guy\" and save the girl, fighting alongside the Shogunate's constables, or take the \"evil path\" and take a stand against local law enforcement. As you progress, you can stick to one path, try to play all sides or skip the story missions of the three factions all together and just explore the side missions of the open world.\n\nAs I explored the story, things got creepy in a hurry. Saving the ambassador unknowingly led my samurai towards a relationship with the young woman... who appears to be around 14 years old. In other playthroughs, I was disturbed to find out the fetish-like love of torture of the Shogunate and his three daughters who run the town. Even though the timetable for the game's story revolves around only a few days, there was more than enough time to find out some very disturbing things about the people of this small town before culminating in a three-round fighting tournament to end my adventure. Each different combination of decisions and allegiances I made lead me on a path to one of the game's ten endings.\n\nBecause of the short length of the story -- ranging between two to four hours depending on how many missions you choose to take on -- multiple playthroughs are encouraged using \"Proof of Life.\" The \"Proof of Life\" concept is an interesting take on the New Game+ option seen in many action games. Instead of just carrying over your previously-established character, the world around you adapts. Choosing a lawless lifestyle where killing constables was common practice leads to an increased presence of law enforcement in the following playthrough. And having an inventory of my own previous character's items to turn to after the first battle of the new playthrough was a welcome surprise. Additionally, points are awarded after each playthrough that can be used to unlock different visual changes for each new game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the game's combat based story missions, there are some other diversions, like playing cards in the gambling den or attempting the act of night crawling. Night crawling helped provide me with one of the most uncomfortable moments I have experienced in gaming, even more than seeing the Shogunate's torture room. After meeting a woman in the day time, I needed to sneak into her home and make it into her room without being caught, subsequently jumping in bed with her in an attempt to get lucky. It might be that the intended humor of the situation is lost in translation because of differences in Japanese and Western humor, what with the disturbing choice of sound effects and animations that resembled a horny teenager jumping in to bed in hopes of losing their virginity. Thankfully, you never have to see the action once you complete the minigame challenge associated with it.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of Way of the Samurai 4 is that combat isn't very fun. I had hoped that running around a Japanese village with a sword and an appetite for mayhem would be the most promising aspect of the game, but sadly, this wasn't the case. To win a battle, you have to launch a constant barrage of attacks against an opponent to prevent them from having the time to recover health. Aside from the unusual nuisance of enemies being able to recover from stab wounds so quickly in the heat of battle, this nonstop attack method will result in fatigue that causes reduced damage from the player's attacks and quicker decay on their weapons. This ends up becoming fairly frustrating early on in your career, when your number of different attacks is still very limited and you don't have enough money to purchase many extra weapons or the items that can help them last longer. If you get caught in a battle against multiple opponents and don't have enough weapons in your stash or vitality-increasing items, things can be over before they even begin.\n\nSadly, the game\u2019s missions don't offer much in the way of variety. Most scenarios revolve around meeting up with an NPC, finding the cause of some conflict and arriving just in time for a small battle. This scenario gets repeated with varying degrees of difficulty, but with the combat not being very fun, the missions get old fast.\n\nVisually, Way of the Samurai 4 didn't do much to excite me. Even though I was able to unlock more customizable parts for my character with each playthrough, nothing ended up being visually impressive. The character models are limited -- especially with facial animations and range of emotion -- and the animations don't flow smoothly together. The dated animations, on top of screen tearing and random frame rate drops, killed the game\u2019s immersive qualities.\n\nWay of the Samurai 4 can only be played with the original Japanese voice cast and English subtitles. While this works for the fans of the franchise, this likewise may deter new players from giving the game a chance, because there isn't an option for an English voice track. Also, the sometimes over the top voice acting makes some serious scenes unbelievable and gives the absurd scenes an even more extreme B-level samurai film feel. The music sometimes has the same problem where an uncomfortably cheerful tune will be playing over a tense encounter.\n\nWith the freedom of an open world combined with inconsistent tone, it\u2019s very hard to tell just what the development team at ACQUIRE Corp was aiming for.  While the story has branching paths, none were especially engrossing or entertaining, and the repetitive combat quickly took its toll. After fighting for honor, for myself and just for the sake of causing chaos in a tiny Japanese village, Way of the Samurai 4 did show me that I would not have been a very well liked person in Japan in the 1850s. But if the real world back then was anything like this game world, I wouldn't have wanted to spend much time there anyway.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

But 13745.html\" class='autolink'>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\n\n But 13745.html\" class='autolink'>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\n\n It's not just the graphic design, although that is suitably crack-laced. It's the game itself that is bizarre. With nutty gameplay tangents and jacked-up battle balance, this game is less a fighting game and more a tweaked action game with a concentration on fighting. This twisted mix will probably put off most fight fans. Even though the original arcade mode is intact, the fighting in JoJo is largely uneven and haphazard to control. If you're looking for a true street fighting game, I'd suggest Street Fighter.  \n\n JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is for somebody completely different. Maybe you, maybe not, but never has a game divided the line so clearly and told everybody else but JoJo fans to go bite themselves. Anime fanatics might find sweetness in the 2D story sequences, which brings the Japanese comic book alive with animation like a Shockwave movie. JoJo is an exercise in style over substance, and although the two are never too far apart, only those already indoctrinated in JoJology need apply.  \n\nGameplay Battling through the game's story mode here in the office, I was constantly asked the same question: \"Wait, isn't JoJo a fighting game?\" And I'd say yes, and tell them to hang around for a battle sequence to show up. Twenty minutes, an R-Type-type shooter, a game of Royal Poker, a boss battle, and a few tarot cards later, I was finally able to show them that yes, JoJo is a fighting game. You just aren't fighting very often. \n\n It's this type of shifting gameplay that draws the line in the sand for JoJo fans. On one hand, some of the games are very, very good. The shooting game sequence is stellar, with several innovations I'd love to see implemented in the next Darius Twin. On the other hand, there are several sequences with Dragon's Lair-style timed-tap gameplay, only randomized to keep players on their toes. These sequences are extremely frustrating, and even if you get good at the timing and hand-eye coordination, there will be instances that will test your patience and endurance. Since this is a fighting game, it would have been nice if Capcom had focused on action sequences akin to fighting, but the randomness of this game is mostly off-putting. Fortunately, quests can be saved in progress, but players may find that they've lost their rhythm if they drop the controller for a while. \n\n Part of what distances JoJo's Bizarre Adventure from your typical sane game player is the Japanglish translation job done here. None of the characters' voices are dubbed, which is fine for purists but means the rest of us will have to wade through page after page of baloney-jabber. It would have been nice if Capcom had added silly English dubs (you know, when everybody sounds like either Ricardo Montalban or Squiggy from Laverne & Shirley), but it wouldn't have helped a lick with the meandering plot and the boatload of mixed characters. Every time I came into a battle with an enemy and he cried out \"Prepare for yet another whipping from the force of my Stand,\" I half expected my character to say, \"Dude, haven't I fought you before? Aww, I can't even remember anymore.\" \n\n What's at the heart of this game is a sticky fighting game that only half appeases Street Fight fans. Most gamers get into fighting games looking for three things: a dude who fights like Ryu, a chick who's as fast as Chun Li, and a big dude who can do cool stuff. After that, everything else and every other character is simply gravy. Unfortunately, while typical Capcom moves are in the game, fight fans will only find vague representations of those necessary characters here. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure comes off more like a early-'90s Data East SF rip-off than a true Capcom fighter -- characters are tall and lanky and the control is a bit stiff. And don't forget that the balance is completely off. \n\n To its credit, however, there are plenty new fighting characters in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, including a scappy puppy and an eagle, that give new dimensions to the gameplay. Also innovative is the Stand system, which you may have to read our  JoJo preview to understand -- I'm still sort of fuzzy on the concept, and I've been playing this game all week long. Basically, it's a ghost that battles as part of your character. The Stand acts somewhat like a permanent VS. tag partner, running out for attacks and teaming up with your character for Super attacks. It can start combos that both fighters can continue, or simply unleash a huge killer move. Technically, with only three attack buttons and limited moves per character, there's not a ton to do in this game, but the Stand does add strategy and depth.  \n\nGraphics What's lovable about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the graphic novel stylings behind the visual design. Outside of the fighting game, and often inside as well, this is the most eclectic game on the system. If you buy this game, pick it up first for the graphics, second for its freaky fighting, and then mull around with it some more just to look at everything. It is a diverse and sharp graphic presentation, with style shifts and animated comic book shows have only been done well in one other instance I can think of (the comic-turned-cartoon The Maxx). This is artistic flexing, pure and simple. \n\n Once you get into battle, the graphics even out a bit more flatly, but there's still buckets full of style, and if you're a devoted Capcom fan it's all for you. The character designs are in Capcom style of cute/ cut / cool, and the characters are always a mix or compliment. The hot chicks have butt-ugly Stand counterparts, the adorable puppy fight ferociously and swiftly in between its adorable ear wag animations, and the heroes have even more hip Stands. Some of the attacks, such as the big mouth that swallows your opponent (then shows him from inside the mouth as he is being gnawed on) are as incredible as they are surreal. \n\n However, those simply looking for a fight without all this gimmicked sideshow antics won't be too happy with this game. It looks very good in motion and in still shots (and the fact that both characters and their Stands can be on screen is a testament to Capcom's 2D mastery, almost making one wonder if SF vs. X-Men might really be doable), it's not exactly conducive to fighting like a true Street Fighter should be. Animation in a fight is stiff and too fast to follow (except, of course, in Super attacks). You lose your timing sometimes because of the animation weaknesses. Characters have a lot of detail and frames of animation, but it's cycled animation with little transition. For instance, a jump kick looks well animated, with the pant legs blowing in the wind from the force, but the actual attack goes from standing to kick, with almost nothing in between. Most attacks use this trick, and while it doesn't look bad, it takes adjustment for those of us used to more precise 2D and even more advanced 3D grapplers. It just doesn't move or feel like Street Fighter, and while the game is fun once you get going, most of us who buy this will do so looking for another SF experience.  \n\nSound Where Capcom really budgeted itself, both in money and PlayStation RAM space, was in the sound. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has all the typical J-Pop music tracks and nonsense character shouts, but they are severely clipped and chirped in this game. The stereo audio and explosive action sounds very lo-fi here, and audiophiles won't like the loss in quality. However, this sacrifice in audio was probably due to memory constraints, particularly with the demanding Stand system. Some may gripe about the lesser sound quality, but it was all for the sake of better gameplay, so let's not harp on it. \n\n What would have been nice, however, is English dialog. The game has thousands of screens of text, and that's a killer in gameplay, particularly in an action game. A fighting game that takes ten minutes before getting to the fight has some priority issues. The story is so garbled that it may not have mattered one way or another whether there was an English dub (most gamers would have simply skipped it and read the text, or just jumped straight ahead to the battles), but I think the game would have been more exciting if gamers weren't constantly brought out of their zone by being asked to read a novel in between battles. \n\nYou know now if you're a JoJo gamer or not. If you read Anoop's nunya-Japanese import reviews on IGNdreamcast, it may be right for you. If you scan anime chat sites daily, this may be your game. If you loved MTV's The Maxx, JoJo is your kind of guy. And if you're thinking right now that it's either Street Fighter, Tekken, or bust, then I need say nothing more to you.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

{"game": "Dark Souls (Prepare to Die Edition)", "index": 21, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/pc-131930", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review", "review": "There are some things that only videogames can do. For me, Dark Souls' predecessor Demon's Souls was emblematic of all of them. Where most games do their best to be something else \u2013 to tell a story like a novel, to impress with cinematic techniques like a film \u2013 Demon's Souls is pure game, a complete and  darkly fascinating vision that makes no concessions to the modern conception of how games should be. Instead, it was an exploration of how games could be; how bleak, how twisted, how focused and \u2013 most famously \u2013 how challenging. Most developers take pains to protect you from failure. FROM Software turns it into an artform. \n\n Dark Souls is the next step along that path. Like Demon's Souls, it is a brutal and demanding third-person action-RPG set in a world full of monstrous, disturbing things that are trying their hardest to end your life as quickly as possible. Using whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge, buy or forge, the challenge is to inch your way through this damned and deadly place, now and then coming across gigantic bosses that take especial valor and tenacity to kill. The eventual aim is to make it out alive, but there are about 50-60 hours of creative cruelty between you and that goal. \n\n You will die, a lot. You will die on the end of a sword, on the edge of an axe, crushed by a boulder,  impaled on fangs; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls. It's education, it's progress, it's the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in gaming \u2013 it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Exactly because your chances of success are so slim, each victory feels monumental. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The open-world structure is the biggest change since Demon's Souls. Beginning in a rotting asylum for the undead, you move through a vast, connected world comprised of fetid swamps, grandly dilapidated towns and castles,  magma-carved caves and tunnels deep within the earth, trap-filled dungeons and much else. Some are reminiscent of Demon's Souls' environments, like the rickety, swampy, disease-ridden Blighttown, whilst others are entirely new; austere marble palaces, murky forests, ashen lakes. \n\n The further you get in Demon's Souls, the more hideous and creative the monsters and environments become. Thirty hours in, stuck in an underground poisonous swamp, you'll feel like you'd give anything to see the sun again. Dark Souls' design is so consistently twisted that it actually starts to encroach on your mental well-being after extended play \u2013 it never wavers for a second from its singular stylistic vision. \n\n There's no central hub, no safe haven for you to run back to and recuperate. Instead, there are bonfires strategically placed around the world. Bonfires are your checkpoints, the place where you can hunker down to replenish your health flasks, spend the souls of vanquished enemies on leveling up, repair your equipment, and meditate on your doomed existence. Resting at a bonfire ensures that you'll spawn there the next time you're dispatched, but resting also respawns all the enemies in an area (except bosses). Deciding when and where to rest, then, becomes a major part of your strategy. You can go through the same areas again and again, collecting souls and learning enemy attack patterns to make yourself stronger, or you can push onwards towards the next bonfire, risking the unknown. \n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end   Online, you'll frequently see the ghosts of other players huddled around the bonfires, giving you a sense of togetherness and camaraderie in situations that would otherwise feel depressingly hopeless. Dark Souls' world is (for the most part) exquisitely designed around these checkpoints \u2013 shortcuts and secret passages open up that let you access more and more of the map from a single resting point, so making your way around a world that at first seems intimidatingly huge quickly becomes second nature. \n\n When you die in Dark Souls, you become Hollowed, and lose any souls that you've collected. Make it back to your bloodstain before dying again, and you can get them back \u2013 but you usually run straight into the clawed arms of whatever horrendous thing dispatched you the first time. Souls can be spent on leveling yourself up, buying an extra sliver of health or stamina or magical capability. Humanity, on the other hand, is much more precious resource; you can only get it from items or by beating bosses, whether in your own game or as a helpful Phantom in someone else's. It can be used to kindle bonfires, giving yourself extra health flasks, and to revive yourself to Human, which lets you summon other players to help you in your game. \n\n The combat system is the beating black heart at the center of Dark Souls. Given the sheer variety of demons after your blood \u2013 serpent-warriors, evil butchers, skinless undead, cat-alligators, skeletal swordsmen and much, much else \u2013 your survival depends greatly on how you adapt to changing situations. You can switch between armored tank and nimble thief just by switching around your weapons and armor. To be a mage or a healer, all you need to do is find a sorcerer's catalyst or a talisman. The game never forces you into a certain playstyle. There's no limit to what you can carry, for instance, so you can hold on to any dagger or bow or interesting spell in case it comes in handy hours later. \n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end   The way that magic works has changed since Demon's Souls, making it much more difficult to rely on it as an easy way out and forcing you to engage with the heart-in-mouth, up-close melee combat. Instead of a magic bar, you get a certain number of casts for each spell each time you rest at a bonfire \u2013 powerful Pyromancy or life-saving Miracles will usually be limited to just a few uses. Magic is as relevant to the game as ever, but it's no longer a cheap-and-easy, rechargeable long-range option. Sooner or later, especially in the boss battles, you're going to have to wade on in there with an axe and risk your hide up close. \n\n This is one of many reasons that Dark Souls is considerably harder than Demon's Souls. (For context, I played through Demon's Souls about four times, and nothing in that game gave me the same trouble \u2013 and the same rush \u2013 as some of Dark Souls' crueler moments.) It appears to be FROM's mission to send you into harrowing spirals of despondency and self-pity at every opportunity. Levels and enemies alike are designed to be especially lethal. Like its predecessor, the game starts off borderline impossible and becomes more manageable the longer you play as you get together some half-decent equipment and build up your stats, but Dark Souls discourages grinding.    \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Symphony", "index": 22, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/symphony/pc-136470", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/30/symphony-review", "review": "Combining Tron-esque, wireframe graphics, a simplistic, arcade-shooter mechanic, and a soundtrack pulled directly from your own hard drive, Symphony is equal parts video game and screensaver. The concept here is that a \u201cdemon\u201d has taken over your music, and you (represented by a sort of fighter-plane-type thingy) have to kill the infestation with a variety of weapons, song by individual song.\n\nWhen you first start up Symphony, the game will search your hard drive for music files (although it does come with some sample music by default). It\u2019ll then import the files you designate as wanting to play with (a time-consuming process, especially for those without powerful PCs and/or SSDs), and build game levels for each song. For all this loading, though, levels don\u2019t seem to differ too much from each other, despite wildly different song types. Occasionally, you'll get different, or more powerful versions of the same enemies, but most of the time, levels are only distinguished from one another by the tempo at which the action happens and the background music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you go with one of Elgar\u2019s Engima Variations or a cut from MF DOOM\u2019s latest album, you\u2019ll still get a top-down view of a monochrome (the single color shifts based on the \u201cintensity\u201d of the song at a given time) background. Wire frame enemies appear from the side and the top, generally in sync with the beat or if there's an \"intensity\" change in the song (i.e., there's more going on instrumentally at a given time), and they occasionally shoot at you. Depending on what difficulty level you\u2019ve chosen \u2013 they go from \u201cpianissimo\u201d (easiest) to \u201cfortissimo\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ll either shoot at you very rarely, or all the damn time.\n\nGameplay for the most part involves moving the mouse around to dodge enemies (your ship tracks your mouse move for move) and blowing up enemies. A few weapons, like missiles, are better held to mouse clicks, but for the most part you're just moving around. This makes the gameplay feel a little thin, which leads to it getting tiresome after multiple songs. After enough time it can get a little repetitive -- or at least that's how it might seem on paper. But something about Symphony\u2019s gameplay is almost zen-like. You go into this zone as you play, where you experience the music and the gameplay as a single activity, and time just slides by.\n\nOf course, some parts of Symphony's gameplay are genuinely repetitive, although not to a degree that it mars the overall impression much, given you play the game in short bursts. Enemies, for example, are pretty much all variations of a very few basic types. Your goal is to destroy them and collect the powerups and energy they drop to increase your score. You have to get to a certain score threshold to \u201cbeat\u201d a level, which allows you to unlock a new weapon or power up for your ship. Then you can choose your ship\u2019s loadout for the next song, mixing and matching weapons and powers to your liking, and even choosing whether you want them to auto-fire or to control when they go off. Since most levels are the same, it\u2019s not really so much a question of choosing the right weapon for the job, but making sure you have a good balance of different kinds of weapons: missiles for the powerful enemies, auto-fire blasters for the low-end ones, and something in between for everything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne weird misstep is that Symphony seems to make the music itself quieter than the sound effects by default, requiring some tweaking to make sure you can actually hear your own personal soundtrack. Other than that, though, the game plays smooth and stable, and even allows you to log into an online leaderboard to compare your successes with others on a given song (yep, it tracks songs by artist and title from the ID3 tags).\n\nGiven its rather simplistic gameplay concept, Symphony manages to be a surprisingly addictive little game. The rewards system whereby you unlock new and unique weapons and abilities each time you beat a level is great \u201ccarrot-on-a-stick\u201d to keep you coming back, and since you\u2019re listening to your own music anyway, you\u2019re guaranteed to at least enjoy the soundtrack. More variety in the graphics and gameplay modes would have helped, but for those who want to listen to music on a long flight, for example, Symphony provides an excellent way to enhance that experience and get a little gaming satisfaction on the way.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms", "index": 23, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-online/pc-109114", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/29/ghost-recon-online-review", "review": "It may seem a little strange to see Ubisoft releasing a free-to-play installment of the long-running Ghost Recon series so soon after May\u2019s release of Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, but here it is. It's officially in open beta and Ubisoft hasn\u2019t done much to market it as a result, but they're already happy to take your money and thus its \u201cbeta\u201d label has about as much meaning as those on almost every social game on Facebook. That\u2019s not such a bad thing, though, because Ghost Recon Online already plays like a full release that simply needs a few meaningful tweaks and patches to nudge it toward greatness. Even better, it\u2019s one of the first Ghost Recon titles designed specifically for the PC in recent years, and that design continually manifests itself in the fluidity and responsiveness of GRO\u2019s controls, combat, and cover options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, at first glance, it\u2019s tempting to dismiss Ghost Recon Online as a humble entry for the franchise because there are only two game modes, four maps, and three classes to enjoy them with. That sampling will likely increase as the game matures and Ubisoft attempts to attract new players with the promise of new content, however, and its 8v8 cover-based combat already works well thanks to the designs of its Recon, Assault, and Specialist classes.\n\nTake the in-your-face-mechanics of the heavily armored Assault class. By activating the Blitz skill, you can storm into enemy encampments and take them down before they\u2019re aware you\u2019re around. Or you could use your Heat power to temporarily blind and fry opponents with a splash of microwaves. Specialists can activate a bubble shield for themselves and their comrades, and other Specialists can disrupt those same bubbles with a devastating EMP skill. And then there\u2019s the Recon class, who can use their \u201cOracle\u201d ability to temporarily reveal the physical outlines of enemies, allowing squadmates or the Recon itself to pick them off before they're any trouble. Recons can also employ a near-invisible cloaking ability that allows them to sneak up on unsuspecting foes and finish them off with point-blank shots (provided, that is, other Recon players haven't revealed them with Oracle). In the right hands, to say the least, the Recon\u2019s abilities make it a formidable sniper.\n\nAnd that\u2019s one of GRO\u2019s biggest problems. There\u2019s technically nothing wrong with the design of all three class\u2019 abilities as they are, and when you find a fairly balanced match, each class has plenty of chances to counter and complement the others\u2019 abilities. Snipers clear the way for Assault soldiers, Assault soldiers charge in to clear the path forward, and Specialists provide protection and utility. But finding a truly balanced match is a rarity with GRO\u2019s current matchmaking design, even with the option to change classes before a match begins. That\u2019s because there aren\u2019t any limits on how many of a certain class are in an arena, which means that it\u2019s not uncommon to find yourself facing almost an entire team of Recon snipers. In one match, almost comically, I faced a group with six Assault players with our seven Recon, and the match quickly turned into a tragic buffalo hunt in which we picked off the Assault soldiers with few worries about our own safety. Spawn camping is thus a problem, even if it\u2019s often situational, and the lack of any ability to change classes mid-game only exacerbates the problem. To Ubisoft\u2019s credit, that\u2019s still not as hopeless of a situation as it might seem, though, thanks to lengthy cooldown timers for special abilities that persist through death and prevent the matches from devolving into unmanageable chaos.\n\nIndeed, unlike the fast-paced slaughterfests you find in a Call of Duty game, matches in either of Ghost Recon Online two modes are usually on the slow and suspenseful side in the spirit of Red Orchestra 2, and a decent default voice comm allows for easy communication of strategies (or, at least, when players are willing to listen). In the Onslaught mode, each team fights to capture two points by sticking around the immediate vicinity of the objective. Once a side has captured them, the defenders make a last stand at a third unlockable point. In Conquest, each team squabbles over five points, with victory going to whoever holds the most objectives by the end of the match. Playing either mode demonstrates that GRO isn\u2019t a game for lone wolves; even with the best armor upgrades it still doesn\u2019t take much to bring you down. Cooperation is thus key \u2013 emphasized by bonuses to XP and currency when you capture objectives instead of scoring kills \u2013 and series of blue-green lines that stretch out from you to your fellow teammates never let you forget the importance of teamwork. It\u2019s a smart move that nudges even suicidal loners toward cooperation, since realizing that you\u2019re way out of sync with those lines is a harrowing reminder of how few options you have if something goes wrong. At the same time, though, it\u2019s disappointing that GRO doesn\u2019t allow for more options to play with your friends in light of the strengths of its cooperative gameplay. You can only bring three buddies from your friends\u2019 list with you into a match (out of a possible eight), and private matches are out of the question.\n\nThe strengths of its design would be for naught if the nuts and bolts of combat weren\u2019t up to par, but GRO\u2019s shooting and cover controls are unfailingly responsive and satisfying. It\u2019s especially nice that all weapons allow you to switch to a first-person perspective for the purposes of aiming, a feature usually restricted to sniper rifles. There\u2019s even a dose of realism in play: when you\u2019re out on the field in the standard third-person view, there\u2019s a slight blur on targets in the distance that goes away once you switch to first-person and aim through your sights. Even the act of dodging for cover seldom disappoints, thanks to the ability to slide into place by pressing your space bar. Lying prone, vaulting, and looking over obstacles almost always occurs without a hitch, and there\u2019s thus a consistent fever pitch of excitement as you rush in on a hidden sniper without the frustrations of shoddy controls. All this takes place against the backdrop of four maps whose compact designs offer plenty of well-placed defensive points for intimate strategic gameplay, but are also visually drab affairs that tend to blend together into a common image of urban or industrial decrepitude. Love natural settings for your manhunts? You won\u2019t find them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the best thing about Ghost Recon Online is that it\u2019s not trying to sneak its way into your wallet at every opportunity. Indeed, it\u2019s so liberal with its in-game currency (known as Recon Points) that you can use them to purchase almost every single item you can buy with cash, and you get them frequently enough that you rarely feel like some perfect weapon in the shop is out of reach unless you whip out your credit card. Even then, most are locked under level requirements and similar milestones to prevent GRO from slipping into dreaded pay-to-win territory, and none of them are powerful enough to keep smart newbies from scoring kills on the best equipped players. The shop as a whole is a dreamland of satisfying if occasionally expensive weapon choices, but rookie players might find the way it includes both complete weapons and weapon parts a little daunting, particularly since it\u2019s not too clear if buying an item like a new sight is a better use of your currency than just buying a whole new gun. If there's a true downside, it's that you'll usually have to buy your grenades if you run out, although it's still possible to earn a few through daily tasks.\n\nWhile not without its issues, Ghost Recon Online is a fun and entertaining cover-based team shooter that rewards cooperation. It\u2019s a shame that humdrum maps and a poor matchmaking setup occasionally sours the promising designs of each class\u2019 special abilities, but when it works, few free-to-play shooters grant such a memorable and thoroughly entertaining experience. Its relaxed approach to microtransactions mark it as a rare free-to-play shooter that manages to avoid the threats of paying to win, and with a few more visually distinctive maps, Ghost Recon Online could give its retail cousins a run for their money. For PC gamers in particular, it\u2019s a welcome but flawed return to form for the popular franchise.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Thirty Flights of Loving", "index": 24, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/thirty-flights-of-loving/pc-138374", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/29/thirty-flights-of-loving-review", "review": "Sometimes the most intriguing tales are told without uttering a single word. Blendo Games' Brendon Chung once again proves himself a master of succinct, abstract first-person storytelling with Thirty Flights of Loving, a short and punchy follow-up to the much buzzed-about 2009 indie freeware hit Gravity Bone. The fact he manages to cram an enjoyably dizzying story into a mere dozen minutes of gameplay is a feat in itself, but what's truly impressive is the narrative weight and emotional impact it delivers in such a short span of time.\n\nThough both games are set in the same pulp universe starring the mysterious Citizen Abel, you don't have to play one to understand or enjoy the other. While Gravity Bone's funky intergalactic spy story gives you some wiggle room to explore and interact with your surroundings as you figure out a bit more of what's going on from brief one mission to the next, Thirty Flights of Loving sports a more urgent pacing and linear flow. You won't find any of Gravity Bone's platforming sections or light inventory puzzlework here. Instead, the focus is squarely placed on the story, the characters, the setting. The limited scope doesn't hurt the experience, because getting drawn into the unfolding adventure is curiously enthralling, particularly given the way this interactive short story plays out in head-spinning vignettes.\n\nThirty Flights of Loving had me hooked from the moment I snuck through a secret exit in the back room of a seedy bar and stumbled into an underground hideout. There, I came face-to-face with my two comrades-in-crime: Anita, a demolitions expert, mechanic, accomplished sniper, and cake maker, and Borges, a forger, safecracker, and pilot. Neither spoke a word, yet something about the way they regarded me instilled a familiar comforting feeling: these guys were my friends.\n\nHanging out amidst a cache of guns, booze, and squawking geese, the pair were preparing for what looked like one hell of a caper. But rather than center around the mission as it unfolds, Thirty Flights of Loving intentionally jumbles its sequence of events, showing you everything but the moment the heist goes down. Therein lies some of its charm. You're given subtle clues as to what's happening and left to read between the lines and interpret the bigger story. It's a jarring but fascinating experiment.\n\nOnce the story gets underway and builds momentum, split-second transitions crop-up erratically, throwing you from one crazy situation to another without warning. One second you're at a wedding party with your mates, chugging booze and grooving it up. The next your staring down the barrel of a gun standing in a pool of someone else's blood. Time flows out of order, seemingly at random, as you leap between various moments from the past to the future. Each fleeting vignette hits like a slap in the face, leaving you dazed for a moment until you get your bearings and the urge for mental detective work kicks back in. It's not an unpleasant feeling, because the constant buzz of absorbing and interpreting each subtle story twist means there's rarely a lull, and the few slower moments that crop-up are very purposeful.\n\nWith limited gameplay that puts greater emphasis on pushing the story along with meager interactions over fleshing out robust mechanics, atmosphere plays a big part in Thirty Flights of Loving's allure. The box-headed characters are charming in their own right, and the dynamic settings you push through are colorful, detailed, and ever-changing. All of this comes together with a great spy-tinged jazzy surf rock soundtrack that further sets the tone for each different scene.\n\nThirty Flights of Loving gets off to a fascinating start before completely throwing any and all expectations you might form during its first few minutes into the wood chipper.

They go to lengths bordering on extreme to give the player such copious amounts of content that folks could sacrifice entire months and not even make a dent in the titles. Legasista is such a game, an action RPG coupling a slew of tried and true mechanics that will leave many fans of in-depth outings drooling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped and published by NIS, Legasista is a top-down dungeon crawler where the player takes a tag team of adventurers, controlled one at a time, through a series of dungeons filled to the brim with monsters, loot and bean sprouts.\n\n poilib start \n\nLegasista is a game for people who enjoy level grinding for the sake of level grinding.\n\n poilib end  Legasista's main strength is in the level of customization that it allows the player. Its job system is incredibly fleshed out, allowing you to commit to a class and fashion a character that exactly matches your personal preference down to the smallest detail, including appearance. Legasista boasts a strong character builder that, with a bit of time and patience, can be used to create just about anybody you want. Coupled with a loot system that can provide a potentially endless variety of gear and a random dungeon generator that can, at a whim, create 100-floor dungeons and it's not hard to see where the foundation of the game's content-rich nature lies. For fans of tinkering, experimentation and customization, Legasista may be your ticket for the rest of the year.\n\nWhich brings us to its problems.\n\nLegasista can be a source of endless hours of enjoyment, but it can also be something of a bore on several levels. The game's story, for instance, is about as soulless a narrative as you're going to find in a modern game. It plays out like a JRPG checklist: you have your plucky hero, an amnesiac woman-child, a randomly buxom witch and a mysterious figure that knows more than they're letting on. It doesn\u2019t help that the Japanese voice acting (supplemented by English subtitles) is terrible, bouncing between mumbling and high pitched yelling. It's a far cry from similar RPGs (Disgaea comes to mind) that ooze charm and personality almost as much as they do content.\n\nThe story is little more than a conceit to get you dungeon crawling, which would be fine if the dungeon crawling itself were, on its own, enthralling. Unfortunately, while Legasista is brimming with bells and whistles to make the overall experience deeper, the actual combat at the center of this action RPG is incredibly standard and bordering on mediocre.\n\nMost engagements with the game's enemies can be resolved with simple button mashing, and while a modicum of finesse is necessary to survive the higher level engagements, the action never evolves beyond whacking your opponent's backside instead of their front. Enemies also tend to exhibit intelligence on par with your basic drone, attacking you mindlessly with little visible thought to self preservation or strategy. Often bringing a speedy sword with decent knockback to a fight is all you'll need to take down opponents several levels higher than you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't so blatantly obvious. A few seconds fighting any foe and you'll often be able to spot some blatant weakness that you can exploit for an easy victory. It\u2019s only when the odds are truly stacked against you that the game even broaches becoming a challenge.\n\nIt's not uncommon, of course, for games with randomly generated dungeons to have a limited pool of visual resources to draw on, but Legasista's crisp and colorful pool is very shallow. Each dungeon can generally be broken down to two or three unique tiles, making for a mundane crawl through blocky terrain.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that Legasista is a game lacking in worth or quality. The game's depth of customization is truly something to be admired and there are many players who will likely fall into the game's world and never give a second thought to its problems. Those looking for a more straightforward action RPG however, might do better to look elsewhere. It's clear, coming out of it, where its resources were invested and its unbalanced quality might leave some disappointed.\n\nLegasista is a game for people who enjoy level grinding for the sake of level grinding. It tailors its experience entirely toward that niche, often to the detriment of everyone else. If you\u2019re looking for dynamic combat, you should pass Legasista. That said, if tinkering with stats and skills is your idea of heaven, you may want to give it a try.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead", "index": 26, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/the-walking-dead-season-1-episode-3/mac-135875", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/28/the-walking-dead-the-game-episode-3-long-road-ahead-review", "review": "The more I play The Walking Dead: The Game, the more I feel my humanity slip away. When I started episode one, I decided to make all the \"good\" choices and be a role model for Clementine. When episode two came around, I wrote about the greater good and said \"It's time to decide if Lee's going to be an upstanding person or a cold-hearted survivor.\" Now, with Episode Three: Long Road Ahead behind me, I can see how foolish all that talk was. Faced with the toughest Walking Dead decisions to date, there was no debate over how a choice would make protagonist Lee Everett look or affect the group. Something happened, and I reacted. Me. Not Lee.\n\nLike few games before it, we are the main character in The Walking Dead: The Game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n poilib start \n\nJust like I watch Rick Grimes evolve every month in The Walking Dead comics, I get to see myself evolve through the lens of Lee Everett with each episode of The Walking Dead: The Game.\n\n poilib end  The third of five episodes (a new one is released about every two months), The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead is best described as a series of peaks and valleys. As Lee, we see our group through some seriously screwed up and emotional moments, as well as a whole bunch of conversations and light gameplay problem solving with the third-person adventure control scheme. The bandits have nowhere else to turn now that the dairy farm is out of commission, Kenny and Lilly are still at odds, and there's a thief in our midst.\n\nIt might not sound like the most amazing pace, but it works incredibly well. By this point, it's safe to assume you've polished off episodes one and two, so you know these characters and have feelings for them -- one way or the other. So, when the season-defining choices appear in Long Road Ahead, there's an emotional aftermath for us as players. When the cast was on the other side of one of the game's big moments, I wanted to wander around and see what they were going through, to talk about what the hell just happened.\n\nThat's a true testament to the story developer Telltale Games delivers. Since episode one, the team has talked about your choices creating your game on a relationship level, but there's an emotional context to all of this, too. Sure, Kenny will still give me crap for siding with Lilly back in the meat locker, but I love the guy as he's always had my back. Maybe you don't because of a choice or fight you had with him, but I do. In my playthrough, these guys are bros.\n\nLong Road Ahead strains the personal narrative I\u2019ve built, fracturing the web of relationships established over four hours. Telltale built these foundations, and now it's testing them. It's infinitely exciting if not extremely depressing at times.\n\nAs usual, the game looks sharp with its bold lines and comic-style art, and the voice acting is above reproach. These two facets really allow you to get lost in the story and notice Lee's pet name for Clem, Duck actually being useful, and Lilly's grief. But, also as usual, the game can stutter in the framerate department. Still, the problems aren't prevalent and the fascinating story carries you through rough patches with ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there's any deviation from what you've known about the game up until this point, it's that Long Road Ahead is perhaps the most \"adventurey\" episode so far. It uses the downtime before and after reality-shattering moments to have you bum around environments trying to figure out how to get from here to there or how to make something work with the objects in your inventory. These aren't challenging puzzles, but the tasks work well to counterbalance those peaks I was talking about -- these lulls are perfectly paced to give you a reason to talk to your fellow survivors and not immediately be on to the next event.\n\nI've been asked if The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead is the best entry yet in Telltale's season, but I don't think it's a fair question. Just like I watch Rick Grimes evolve every month in The Walking Dead comics, I get to see myself evolve through the lens of Lee Everett with each episode of The Walking Dead: The Game. That's fascinating and disturbing at the same time. Each episode makes me care more and more about these characters, so the events of Long Road Ahead make it the most impactful episode to date. It's a disturbing, depressing and entertaining entry in a journey that's been nothing short of excellent so far.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria", "index": 27, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/pc-114681", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/04/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria-review", "review": "Unlike Cataclysm, which tried to be the expansion for everyone, the fourth expansion to Blizzard\u2019s perennially popular MMO is aimed at the experienced player, adding in plenty of high level content to churn through after leveling from 85 to the new cap of 90. If you\u2019ve been away from WoW for a while, much of the core experience remains the same: it\u2019s a ceaseless pursuit of power, where acquiring better items opens up access to more challenging content, which lets you acquire even better items to access even more challenging content, and on and on as you rise from lowly nothing to slayer of the world\u2019s greatest evils. It\u2019s a familiar formula, and still feels rewarding, where your in-game character serves as a controllable trophy rack, broadcasting to others the towering terrors you were skilled enough to defeat, inspiring envy in low-level onlookers and fueling personal pride.\n\nBlizzard\u2019s clearly learned a lot over World of Warcaft\u2019s nearly eight year run, and has molded questing in Mists of Pandaria into its finest form yet; a focused, fast-paced, story-heavy experience. Goals are always clustered close together, usually supported by a strong narrative, dressed up with a surprising amount of voiced dialogue and quick in-game cut-scenes that never take you out of the action for long. You\u2019re often shuttled between locations in custom rides; you may hop on a hot air balloon or ride atop the back of a slithering dragon to take in Pandaria\u2019s beautiful sights while you\u2019re given more of the story. There\u2019s a lot of content to see from level 85 to 90, and because of all the attention to detail, there\u2019s little dead space.\n\nThe presence of all that detail helps to fight back against the wearying grind that tends to set in while playing many MMOs, as it feels like the surrounding world changes based on your actions. Monuments crumble, monsters rise from the ocean and the configurations of NPCs in settlements change to reinforce the idea that that Pandaria\u2019s story has a direction and momentum normally reserved for single-player games.\n\nClever alterations of quest mechanics keep the fun from slowing to a standstill. The majority of quests have kill and collect goals -- familiar territory for any MMO player -- but few are ever exactly the same. In Townlong Steppes, for example, you\u2019ll find a multitude of quests to kill mantids. In one you\u2019ll use a flare to uncover cloaked mantids, in another you\u2019ll kick barrels at mantids and rely on NPC archers to set the creatures aflame and burn through their heavy armor, and in another you\u2019ll kill mantids on a battlefield bristling with explosions. Though you\u2019re always given the same core task, the mixing of rules keeps the quests interesting. The variations also correspond to the storyline, making them feel justified instead of frivolously added for variety\u2019s sake. Considering this is largely true of the entire 85 to 90 run, it\u2019s an especially impressive achievement.\n\nMixed in you get the occasional vehicle quest where you fire turrets at invading armies or stomp evil monkeys while riding atop a rampaging beast. These alternative quest types help break up the pacing, but are used sparingly so they\u2019re never disruptive. Blizzard also gives even lowly enemies special attack types that require you to stay mobile, helping to occasionally alter the rhythm of standard skill rotation combat.\n\nThe writing throughout is also generally strong, taking an ominous tone as the story turns to matters of a rising evil within the typically peaceful land of Pandaria. Though the characters aren\u2019t especially deep, and there are certainly moments of eye-rolling cheesiness as characters strike a tone a little too serious for their own good, it\u2019s still surprisingly easy to get swept up in the tale, thanks in part to the stellar soundtrack. Despite the dire circumstances in Pandaria, WoW still never loses its characteristic goofy humor, so, even as you face off against monstrous beasts, you\u2019re never far from a quest that asks you to shove yaks through a car wash-like contraption, keeping a necessary sense of levity in Pandaria\u2019s hyper colorful world of preposterously large shoulder pads and even bigger vegetables.\n\nAs much as Blizzard does well, there are still a few dud quests mixed in, which conjure stinging memories of WoW\u2019s early days. They aren\u2019t especially frequent, and perhaps stand out so sharply because the rest of the questing is so smooth. Questing doesn\u2019t stop after hitting level 90, either, as Blizzard built in a large number of daily quests related to Pandaria\u2019s various factions. The clear the goal was to make the journey to exalted status a little more palatable than the routine grind, so Blizzard fashioned each faction into more plausible pockets of civilization within Pandaria. This idea of more thoroughly developed factions is most strongly exemplified by the Tillers\u2019 home area, where you\u2019re given a private farm to cultivate and upgrade, and can run dailies to gain favor with the faction as well as improve standing with individual NPCs. The level 90 zone Vale of Eternal Blossoms is another strong example, where a rotating set of daily tasks change up your routine and send you further across the zone as your standing increases, giving reputation grinding more of a sense of progression.\n\nStill, the appeal of logging in to run multitudes of dailies with slightly altered goals \u2013 one day you might fight a giant crocodile in the Vale, the next a wolf with sword between its teeth \u2013 begins to wear thin pretty quickly. It\u2019s still a grind, it\u2019s just presented better, and only one piece of Blizzard\u2019s end game in Pandaria.\n\nThough four dungeons unlock as you level up from 85, the real experience doesn\u2019t start until heroics open up at level 90. These dungeons aren\u2019t prohibitively challenging and can be conquered by pretty much anyone with moderate skill. The focus in on big fights, not trash mobs, so for the majority of each dungeon run you\u2019ll engage towering bosses who exhibit unique attack patterns. Some require you to launch yourself from turrets to exploit weak points, some strafe battle zones with flame so your party needs to flee to the edges, some cast debilitating debuffs and spawn shadow minions, and others teleport you around the battle zone and activate environmental hazards to ensure need to stay alert and active in a fight, resulting in satisfying rounds of combat that don\u2019t suffer from unnecessary frustration.\n\nEach dungeon is also threaded with a significant amount of story content and features elaborately staged encounters. Blizzard knows how to tease its climactic battles better than most other developers, building dungeons like Temple of the Jade Serpent and Stormstout Brewery out in the open world and sending you through on quests, building excitement for the eventual dungeon run and making the structures and creatures feel like natural pieces of a cohesive, and often gorgeous, virtual world.\n\nIf heroic dungeons are still too intimidating for you, Blizzard included Scenarios, a more forgiving type of instanced content built for three players. Though less challenging, Scenarios, don\u2019t do anything substantially better than any other part of the game and don\u2019t offer rewards that justify the time investment. Perhaps moving forward Blizzard will continue to roll out important story events in Scenario format (such as with Theramore\u2019s Fall), but even with some creative quest designs, Scenarios just don\u2019t have much of an identity, and feel wholly disconnected from the rest of Pandaria, directly contrasting with Blizzard\u2019s efforts to better intertwine instanced dungeon content with the world at large.\n\nFor more dedicated players, Blizzard built in challenge modes for Pandaria\u2019s dungeons, where groups can race to knock down bosses and post clear times to online leaderboards and claim rewards. This, along with raid content that\u2019s just beginning to roll out, seems like it could become an important piece of the WoW experience for more hardcore players in the months to come, as it provides a way for competitive PvE players to really get a sense of how they compare with the rest of the community.\n\nIn case PvE encounters aren\u2019t very exciting to you, the PvP game was expanded with two Battlegrounds, both of which feature well-designed game modes that feel very different and provide plenty of tactical depth. On Silvershard Mines, your team needs to capture automated minecarts that run along tracks while preventing the enemy from taking over and doing the same. It\u2019s fast and frantic and results in a satisfying game of risk and reward as some teammates must stay back to defend while others need to band together into assault groups to chase down moving, sometimes heavily guarded targets within a time limit. The Temple of Kotmogu is even more hectic as teams fight over four controllable orbs and hold them to score points, a setup where quick reflexes, communication and sharp situational awareness can make a huge difference in the ensuring chaotic melee.\n\nWhile this is all content for high level players, there is a reason to start all the way back at level one. The added Monk class can be played as a tank, damage dealer or healer, and is built with mechanics for each specialization that mesh well with the class\u2019 history within Blizzard lore as an agile brewmaster. As a tank the Monk shatters kegs of alcohol on the ground to generate threat, then can light soaked foes on fire by spewing flame breath. While tuned to deal damage, the Monk gains a rapid-fire punch attack that stuns and harms enemies in an arc in front of him, great for setting up lesser enemies for punishment from others in dungeons. He can also pile on spikes of damage by unleashing whirling kicks at enemies, with a chance to spawn replenishing orbs after making kills. With a distinct rhythm of gameplay as he builds and spends two resource types, the Monk is a fun, versatile and genuinely different addition to World of Warcraft\u2019s already stellar class lineup.\n\nLeveling up through all that old content can be a huge chore, though it\u2019s expedited somewhat by a daily buff accessible to the Monk that temporarily boosts experience gain. With the recently reworked talent system that trashed the old talent trees entirely, leveling also doesn\u2019t have the same giddy sense of nonstop rewards it used to. You\u2019re only able to make a talent decision every fifteen levels, activating one talent out of three per tier. Though the less frequent decision making does deflate the excitement of powering up, the new talent system does force some interesting choices, as some are better suited for soloing, filling specific group roles or PvP.\n\nThe talent system was recently changed for all WoW players, so there\u2019s no need to pick up Mists to see what Blizzard did. The same goes for playing as the Pandaren race and participating in pet battles, a completely optional Pokemon-like combat system that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. The system lets you fight with, level up and customize all pets you currently own and collect many more throughout World of Warcraft\u2019s zones. The turn-based combat is surprisingly deep, with plenty of differing attack types, defenses, exploitable weaknesses and status ailments. It even features a fully functioning matchmaker, so you can usually find a fight with a live player within seconds. Though the only rewards are achievements and more experience for your pets, it\u2019s a really satisfying system, and hopefully something Blizzard will continue to refine.\n\nMists of Pandaria is an expansion built for the high level player that shows off Blizzard\u2019s skill with dungeon design and offers plenty of rewards for long-term play. It\u2019s also the best questing in World of Warcraft, with strong emphasis on storytelling, resulting in an entertaining run from 85 to 90 that seldom tumbles into tedium. While not all the new systems dazzle, more than anything, Mists proves that Blizzard\u2019s venerable MMO is still one of the best around, a mix of breezy questing, top tier class design, and multiple systems to encourage the cutthroat competition that props up the end game.  World of Warcraft is still devilishly effective at teasing god-like power, where you start with nothing and climb step by step up a colossal mountain of progression until you can, someday, spike a flag into its peak, look out across the vastness of your experience and revel in a sublime sense of dominance.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

You're unleashed in these expansive 2D levels to knock off special monsters to gain access to new areas.\n\n poilib start \n\nPlaying Hell Yeah just makes me want to play something else.\n\n poilib end  You do this by platforming in your saw blade jetpack. You can double-jump to ledges and then cut enemies to smithereens or drill through obstructions. When you run into one of the 100 monsters, you need to break out weapons like a Gatling gun or rocket launcher to get the job done while dodging their attacks. When you get one down to a final move, a WarioWare-like mini-game pops up to deal the killing blow. Sometimes the game tosses in stuff like a shoot'em up space level, but it always comes back to platforming.\n\nAll of this works; it's just that none of it is all that fun. The platforming is plagued by floaty controls and the inability to use the D-Pad. (Yes, worse than LittleBigPlanet's.) You can only fire weapons when you're aiming with the right stick, but some of the boss battles require you to jump, so switching and fighting becomes cumbersome and unsatisfying. The radar in the lower right corner gives you a general sense of where bad guys are, but I needed to pause and look at the big map to figure out where the hell I was. Those Wario Ware games sound clever, but you never know what to do the first time you play one of them, so cheap deaths occur on top of the already subpar checkpoint system.\n\nRemember, looks can be deceiving.\n\nThese drawbacks suck the life out of Hell Yeah. The written dialogue can be funny and the characters are unique, but the actual gameplay steered me away from caring one iota about the game. That's a shame as Hell Yeah has tons to do and unlock in the way of hats, saw blade mods and weapon upgrades. There's even an island you banish beaten foes to. Once there, the former bad guys are put to work and create money or items or surprises.\n\nStill, these options are stilted by the general malaise of the game (and technical problems such as the sound cutting out). Hell Yeah just doesn't know what it wants to be and feels like it's trying too hard at everything. There are good ideas, but that's not enough.\n\nHell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit has all the components of a great game, but they never come together. The platforming is sloppy, the checkpoints are bogus, and the sprawling levels are uninteresting. \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Rather than just a slightly expanded repackaging of the latest generation\u2019s core titles (a la Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Crystal, Emerald or Platinum), this direct sequel breaks the Pok\u00e9mon mid-generation mold by offering a brand new adventure in the Unova region. What you might expect is more of the same - and for the most part, that\u2019s what you get. Considering the caliber of what came before, this certainly isn\u2019t a bad thing - but White 2 manages to complement this \u201csame\u201d with some truly apt refinements and a stunning amount of fresh content. The final result is a game that features some of the most cinematic moments the franchise has ever seen, and the most fully realized Pok\u00e9mon game to ever make use of the DS hardware.\n\nTo start, it\u2019s important to understand that Pok\u00e9mon White 2 doesn\u2019t seek to upend the basic Pok\u00e9mon formula, simply to refine and expand it. You can expect to employ the same expertly crafted, turn-based mechanics as ever, catch a variety of fantastical creatures and acquire eight gym badges - but don\u2019t let the similarities fool you. Pok\u00e9mon White 2 also offers an overwhelming amount of new content. In addition to new main characters, new areas and a new storyline, the revamped Unova region supplies copious amounts of entertainment for your journey to Victory Road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGyms have always played an important role in the Pok\u00e9mon experience, and they\u2019re at their best in White 2. The gyms themselves are far grander than in previous games. You\u2019ll find Elesa\u2019s roller coasters supplemented by a booming catwalk, Burgh\u2019s gym covered in silk cocoons \u2013 and, while I won\u2019t spoil it for you, suffice to say that Drayden\u2019s domain presents an epic homage to the dragon-tamer\u2019s type of choice.\n\nAdditional opportunities to test your team and flex your skills include the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament, a new in-game event where you can face off against gym leaders and champions from past titles. The inclusion of a constantly running tourney is a brilliant addition, as it provides an exciting venue for honing your battle skills, and it\u2019s a pleasure re-challenging some of the most iconic characters from the franchise\u2019s rich history.\n\nWhile battling is still the game\u2019s main draw, a multitude of other activities round out the finely balanced experience. Pok\u00e9Star Studios, for instance, lets you make miniature movies with your favorite monsters while testing your knowledge of type advantages. It\u2019s in the same vein as the Pok\u00e9mon Musicals, which are returning from Black and White - both are a tad frivolous compared to the rest of the game, but as an optional diversion they\u2019re quite amusing if you\u2019re in the right mood. There\u2019s also Join Avenue, an area populated by trainers you\u2019ve connected with via the game\u2019s seamless IR, wireless and online communications. While it\u2019s fun hanging out with your friends\u2019 avatars, the main draw here is the variety of specialty shops you can encourage them to set up, each offering a range of unique goods or services for your shopping pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series continues to advance portable multiplayer in other ways as well, with additions like the revamped Entralink\u2019s new Fun Fest Missions. The incredible thing about these quests - which range from chasing down berries to catching Pok\u00e9mon - is that they allow up to 100 players to connect locally and simultaneously experience the Unova region together. Paired with the Xtransceiver, an impressive video chat feature returning from Black and White, these options present a fun way for fellow trainers to easily connect, interact, and arrange matches or trades on the fly.\n\nPok\u00e9mon collecting has also been improved for White 2, made far easier by the game\u2019s innovative Habitat List function. A new feature of your Pok\u00e9dex, the Habitat List allows you to track which monsters you\u2019ve encountered and caught in each location. This makes it incredibly simple to systematically clear each area, filling out your dex along the way. It\u2019s a brilliant tool, especially for Pok\u00e9mon completionists, and served to completely reignite my desire to catch \u2018em all. It helps that the game boasts the largest regional Pok\u00e9dex yet, with nearly 300 monsters spanning all five generations. This allows for far greater variety in the monsters you encounter, and also means there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to fill your dex without looking to past games.\n\nA handful of other supplementary features further elevate and flesh out the experience, such as the new medal system. Medals are basically the Pok\u00e9mon equivalent to achievements or trophies, and offer great incentive to challenge yourself on your Pok\u00e9mon journey. The game has more than 200 medals for dedicated trainers to earn for things like checking all the trashcans for hidden items or winning lots of battles at the Battle Subway. The new Unova is also home to secret areas called Pok\u00e9mon Grottoes, where you can nab yourself some rare items or monsters. Locating these grottoes is no small feat, but it\u2019s incredibly fulfilling when you do, especially considering the variety of prizes you can collect from these regenerating hideouts.\n\nThe new key system also represents a great stride for the franchise. With a handful of \u201ckeys\u201d to collect by fulfilling certain requirements (like beating the game or capturing a certain Pok\u00e9mon), White 2 allows you to manipulate the game in ways you never could before. With the right key you can actually change the game\u2019s difficulty from normal to either hard or easy, a first for the series. It\u2019s a remarkably successful way to allow for further customization of your game experience, and the ability to trade keys between versions means players who don\u2019t meet the requirements can still get in on the action.\n\nIf Princess Leia was a Pokemon trainer...\n\nThe story presented in Black and White was easily the most captivating in series history, and White 2 only deepens and expands the narrative set forth in those games. The renewed threat of the reformed Team Plasma (and the clash between the members who just wanted power and those who really thought N was helping Pok\u00e9mon) adds fresh context and depth to this scenario, and culminates in a truly epic conclusion. While the story stands on its own, watching this arc come to a close should prove especially fulfilling for fans of Black and White.\n\nConsidering this direct sequel continues the previous game\u2019s story (albeit with a new main hero and new motivations), it\u2019s remarkable how fresh and new it all feels. While you revisit many of the same towns and routes, most have seen significant changes in the two years since the original games. You\u2019ll also find several entirely new places to explore, and some of the returning areas are nearly unrecognizable. The small town of Driftveil, for instance, has positively boomed, largely thanks to the newly established Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament. Returning characters have also grown with the passing of time, and it\u2019s a great joy to see not only how Unova has changed and prospered, and but also how time has treated old friends like Cheren (now a full-fledged gym leader) and Bianca (now assisting Professor Juniper as she tries to figure herself out).\n\nAs an additional reward for players who beat Black or White, White 2 comes with the new Memory Link system, which unlocks supplementary vignettes if you link your copy of the game with your Black/White save file. While they\u2019re not necessary for enjoying or understanding White 2\u2019s story, these short snippets serve to shed light on what took place in the two years between games. Linking your save files also means characters in White 2 mention \u201cthe hero who saved Unova\u201d by name, a cool nod for those who took the time to stop Team Plasma the first time around.\n\nMuch like Black and White, White 2 employs a blended use of 2D sprite art and 3D graphics. The resulting visual style is at its most impressive here, and the expanded yet subtle use of 3D makes for some truly epic and cinematic moments as the story progresses. White 2 also boasts four distinct seasons. You\u2019ll see Unova covered in powdery snow, piles of fallen leaves and puddles of fresh spring rain, visual effects that are not only lovely, but also inform the accessibility of certain areas and affect how you traverse the environment. Much like the rest of the package, the visual presentation of White 2 perfectly realizes the potential of the Pok\u00e9mon series on DS hardware. The fog in the trees, the sweeping caves and mountains fading into the distance, your footprints in the sand and reflection in the water - small touches like these make for a beautiful and memorable world that is brimming with life.\n\nPok\u00e9mon White Version 2 is far more than a traditional mid-generation release, with enough new and repurposed content to keep you occupied for months on end. It offers an addicting, expertly crafted and glorious realization of turn-based role-playing at its best, and functions as the most complete and balanced Pok\u00e9mon game yet, as well as the full realization of what a 2D Pok\u00e9mon adventure should look, feel and play like. If you played Black or White - get this game. It's an even more refined version of that already excellent experience, with more than enough \"new\" to set itself apart. If you're seeking a deep, portable RPG, regardless of whether you\u2019ve ever thrown a Pok\u00e9 ball in your life - get this game, as it\u2019s one of the crown jewels of the genre on the DS hardware. And finally, if you've played Pok\u00e9mon before and want to experience the richest experience the series has to offer - look no further than Pok\u00e9mon White 2.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "War of the Roses", "index": 30, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/war-of-the-roses-140577/pc-115849", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/04/war-of-the-roses-review", "review": "Despite its name, the historic War of the Roses was a savage, nasty affair; a time of usurpers and betrayals, of massacres and sieges, and in the words of Shakespeare, it all took place in \u201ca world grown so bad, that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.\u201d What\u2019s more, it also served as the inspiration for much of the storyline of George R.R. Martin\u2019s brutal Song of Ice and Fire series, which perhaps makes this an especially good time to release a game based on the conflict. Fatshark's War of the Roses does little to immerse you in this rich setting aside from snippets of text from Richard III and the white and red roses of the houses of York and Lancaster on loading screens, but the combat goes a long way toward making up for this oversight. It\u2019s like a Battlefield mod that swaps out the guns for crossbows and longswords, and for the most part, it works.\n\nWar of the Roses doesn\u2019t have much in the way of gameplay variety, though. You\u2019ll find no single-player content here aside from a series of tutorials (which may be for the best because the NPCs involved spend most of their time running into walls and getting stuck on fences), and the only variety in the game proper springs from seven different maps that pit two teams of 32 players against each other in a free-for-all deathmatch mode and a Conquest mode that focuses on capturing points scattered across the map. It\u2019s regrettable that neither of these options prohibit respawns as in the similar Mount and Blade series, but this is a game that glories in the chaos of mass combat, and the good news is that the combat\u2019s usually fun enough to make up for its structural shortcomings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis satisfaction stems from a rare balance of realism and deceptive simplicity, with most attacks based on subtle movements of your mouse. It\u2019s more challenging than it looks. For one, you have to hold down the left mouse button until a circular gauge hits a sweet spot for powerful attacks. Parrying, on the other hand, requires holding down the right mouse button. These elements may not be all that tough on their own, but War of the Roses tosses in an additional element of complexity by forcing you to aim your mouse in the direction in which you wish to stab or parry. It seems clunky at first, particularly for melee players, but in time I came to appreciate how these delays approximate the feel of real combat. Every move counts, and thus one-on-one duels are tense affairs that never fail to excite. If only that extended to the fluidity of the animations themselves; the act of raising your shield and delivering attacks seems a little more choppy than it could be, and the extra mouse movements required in combat make ranged combat exceptionally easier to handle than melee.\n\nBut developer Fatshark sprinkles much of the rest of the experience with realism as well, which especially stands out in the case of longbowmen. It only takes a couple of seconds for an archer\u2019s arms to grow tired from pulling back his bowstring (consider: medieval longbows had an insane draw weight of around 140 pounds), and crossbows--true to life--take an eternity to reload. You\u2019ll also find realism in the way that plate armor defects arrows easily enough but buckles under the weight of maces, and you\u2019ll see it in the way that extremely well-placed arrows can fly through the visor of a combatant\u2019s helmet to deliver horrifying wounds to the face. Overcoming these armor-based obstacles yields satisfying kills, made all the more enjoyable by a downed state that both gives you a few seconds to execute your opponent or time for allies to bandage them.\n\nThe executions themselves seldom fail to impress. Taking the time to finish off your opponent leaves you open to all kinds of enemy attacks, which means that archers or nearby melee players can take you down while you\u2019re trying to jab your sword into your prey\u2019s face. I\u2019ve seen some intrepid players even use dying allies as impromptu bait, such as archers who calmly pick off enemies who rush to put their comrades out of misery. It\u2019s also just fun to watch the executions play out (even from the view of the defeated, which makes you watch your incoming death while sprawled on your back), and even better, you get a hefty payout for successfully enacting the scene to its grisly end.\n\nEven war can sometimes look pretty.\n\nThese payouts determine your path to glory. You don\u2019t start your adventures in the War of the Roses as a knight in shining armor; instead, you\u2019re lowly footman who\u2019s outmatched against veteran players in almost every way imaginable. It\u2019s intimidating for new players, to be sure, but War of the Roses\u2019 steep learning curve places a high value on skill over gear or weaponry, so it\u2019s always possible for smart footmen to strike down the toughest knights with well-timed stabs and blocks. After grinding and earning enough gold from kills and wins, you\u2019ll unlock the advanced classes of Crossbowman, Longbowman, and Footknight, and beyond that you can access perks for customizable classes that let you mix and match among the four\u2019s abilities and ride horses as well. It's a slow process, and the lack of gameplay variety makes the grind lapse into tedium at times, but you'll feel an unmistakable sense of triumph once you ditch your pitiful footman trappings for heavy armor or deadly longbows.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that the absence of an option to disable respawns robs War of the Roses of the sense of achievement that springs from being the last man standing, but Fatshark goes a long way toward making up for the loss through the camaraderie of its squads. As in Battlefield, you can spawn alongside your squad members, rendering the conquest mode more manageable than it would have been without squads. There\u2019s also a welcome option to create your own coat of arms that makes your favorite enemies more readily identifiable on the battlefield, and thus I\u2019ve fought in several matches where players zeroed in on my shield\u2019s green duck like the Roman Inquisition on Giordano Bruno.\n\nIt\u2019s all fun when it works, but War of the Roses isn't without its balance issues and bugs. Trampling enemies while on horseback is good fun, for instance, but there\u2019s a clear imbalance in play when one side has horses and one doesn\u2019t. Heavy armor feels a tad too invulnerable (made all the worse by the way it barely slows down its wearers), and little bugs dot the playthrough as a whole. More than once I found myself plummeting off the side of a building when I tried to spawn next to my squadmates, and I once saw a player on horseback disappear after he and his horse both fell through the battleground. It also suffers from a noticeable lack of optimization, so decent systems that can usually run graphically intense games might experience a barrage of framerate stutters even on modest settings.\n\nWar of the Roses isn\u2019t quite Mount and Blade or Battlefield, but it manages to walk a fine line between the two models to produce an innovative and enjoyable experience. Its mere two gameplay modes and seven maps feel limited and its learning curve might frighten away the most casual players, but its combat feels properly bloody and rewarding, and there\u2019s enough customization available here to stave off any fears of a winter of discontent. There\u2019s a chance that Fatshark will make the price of admission easier to swallow with its promises of regular upcoming content, but, even in its current state, it's one of the best (and only) takes on chaotic open medieval combat.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Pokemon Black Version 2", "index": 31, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version-2/nds-129224", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/04/pokemon-black-version-2-review", "review": "Don\u2019t underestimate Pok\u00e9mon Black Version 2. Rather than just a slightly expanded repackaging of the latest generation\u2019s core titles (a la Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Crystal, Emerald or Platinum), this direct sequel breaks the Pok\u00e9mon mid-generation mold by offering a brand new adventure in the Unova region. What you might expect is more of the same - and for the most part, that\u2019s what you get. Considering the caliber of what came before, this certainly isn\u2019t a bad thing - but Black 2 manages to complement this \u201csame\u201d with some truly apt refinements and a stunning amount of fresh content. The final result is a game that features some of the most cinematic moments the franchise has ever seen, and the most fully realized Pok\u00e9mon game to ever make use of the DS hardware.\n\nTo start, it\u2019s important to understand that Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 doesn\u2019t seek to upend the basic Pok\u00e9mon formula, simply to refine and expand it. You can expect to employ the same expertly crafted, turn-based mechanics as ever, catch a variety of fantastical creatures and acquire eight gym badges - but don\u2019t let the similarities fool you. Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 also offers an overwhelming amount of new content. In addition to new main characters, new areas and a new storyline, the revamped Unova region supplies copious amounts of entertainment for your journey to Victory Road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGyms have always played an important role in the Pok\u00e9mon experience, and they\u2019re at their best in Black 2. The gyms themselves are far grander than in previous games. You\u2019ll find Elesa\u2019s roller coasters supplemented by a booming catwalk, Burgh\u2019s gym covered in silk cocoons \u2013 and, while I won\u2019t spoil it for you, suffice to say that Drayden\u2019s domain presents an epic homage to the dragon-tamer\u2019s type of choice.\n\nAdditional opportunities to test your team and flex your skills include the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament, a new in-game event where you can face off against gym leaders and champions from past titles. The inclusion of a constantly running tourney is a brilliant addition, as it provides an exciting venue for honing your battle skills, and it\u2019s a pleasure re-challenging some of the most iconic characters from the franchise\u2019s rich history.\n\nWhile battling is still the game\u2019s main draw, a multitude of other activities round out the finely balanced experience. Pok\u00e9Star Studios, for instance, lets you make miniature movies with your favorite monsters while testing your knowledge of type advantages. It\u2019s in the same vein as the Pok\u00e9mon Musicals, which are returning from Black and White - both are a tad frivolous compared to the rest of the game, but as an optional diversion they\u2019re quite amusing if you\u2019re in the right mood. There\u2019s also Join Avenue, an area populated by trainers you\u2019ve connected with via the game\u2019s seamless IR, wireless and online communications. While it\u2019s fun hanging out with your friends\u2019 avatars, the main draw here is the variety of specialty shops you can encourage them to set up, each offering a range of unique goods or services for your shopping pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series continues to advance portable multiplayer in other ways as well, with additions like the revamped Entralink\u2019s new Fun Fest Missions. The incredible thing about these quests - which range from chasing down berries to catching Pok\u00e9mon - is that they allow up to 100 players to connect locally and simultaneously experience the Unova region together. Paired with the Xtransceiver, an impressive video chat feature returning from Black and White, these options present a fun way for fellow trainers to easily connect, interact, and arrange matches or trades on the fly.\n\nPok\u00e9mon collecting has also been improved for Black 2, made far easier by the game\u2019s innovative Habitat List function. A new feature of your Pok\u00e9dex, the Habitat List allows you to track which monsters you\u2019ve encountered and caught in each location. This makes it incredibly simple to systematically clear each area, filling out your dex along the way. It\u2019s a brilliant tool, especially for Pok\u00e9mon completionists, and served to completely reignite my desire to catch \u2018em all. It helps that the game boasts the largest regional Pok\u00e9dex yet, with nearly 300 monsters spanning all five generations. This allows for far greater variety in the monsters you encounter, and also means there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to fill your dex without looking to past games.\n\nA handful of other supplementary features further elevate and flesh out the experience, such as the new medal system. Medals are basically the Pok\u00e9mon equivalent to achievements or trophies, and offer great incentive to challenge yourself on your Pok\u00e9mon journey. The game has more than 200 medals for dedicated trainers to earn for things like checking all the trashcans for hidden items or winning lots of battles at the Battle Subway. The new Unova is also home to secret areas called Pok\u00e9mon Grottoes, where you can nab yourself some rare items or monsters. Locating these grottoes is no small feat, but it\u2019s incredibly fulfilling when you do, especially considering the variety of prizes you can collect from these regenerating hideouts.\n\nThe new key system also represents a great stride for the franchise. With a handful of \u201ckeys\u201d to collect by fulfilling certain requirements (like beating the game or capturing a certain Pok\u00e9mon), Black 2 allows you to manipulate the game in ways you never could before.

Telltale built these foundations, and now it's testing them. It's infinitely exciting if not extremely depressing at times.\n\nAs usual, the game looks sharp with its bold lines and comic-style art, and the voice acting is above reproach.

It uses the downtime before and after reality-shattering moments to have you bum around environments trying to figure out how to get from here to there or how to make something work with the objects in your inventory. These aren't challenging puzzles, but the tasks work well to counterbalance those peaks I was talking about -- these lulls are perfectly paced to give you a reason to talk to your fellow survivors and not immediately be on to the next event.\n\nI've been asked if The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead is the best entry yet in Telltale's season, but I don't think it's a fair question. Just like I watch Rick Grimes evolve every month in The Walking Dead comics, I get to see myself evolve through the lens of Lee Everett with each episode of The Walking Dead: The Game. That's fascinating and disturbing at the same time. Each episode makes me care more and more about these characters, so the events of Long Road Ahead make it the most impactful episode to date.

When I started episode one, I decided to make all the \"good\" choices and be a role model for Clementine. When episode two came around, I wrote about the greater good and said \"It's time to decide if Lee's going to be an upstanding person or a cold-hearted survivor.\" Now, with Episode Three: Long Road Ahead behind me, I can see how foolish all that talk was. Faced with the toughest Walking Dead decisions to date, there was no debate over how a choice would make protagonist Lee Everett look or affect the group. Something happened, and I reacted. Me. Not Lee.\n\nLike few games before it, we are the main character in The Walking Dead: The Game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n poilib start \n\nJust like I watch Rick Grimes evolve every month in The Walking Dead comics, I get to see myself evolve through the lens of Lee Everett with each episode of The Walking Dead: The Game.\n\n poilib end  The third of five episodes (a new one is released about every two months), The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead is best described as a series of peaks and valleys. As Lee, we see our group through some seriously screwed up and emotional moments, as well as a whole bunch of conversations and light gameplay problem solving with the third-person adventure control scheme. The bandits have nowhere else to turn now that the dairy farm is out of commission, Kenny and Lilly are still at odds, and there's a thief in our midst.\n\nIt might not sound like the most amazing pace, but it works incredibly well. By this point, it's safe to assume you've polished off episodes one and two, so you know these characters and have feelings for them -- one way or the other. So, when the season-defining choices appear in Long Road Ahead, there's an emotional aftermath for us as players. When the cast was on the other side of one of the game's big moments, I wanted to wander around and see what they were going through, to talk about what the hell just happened.\n\nThat's a true testament to the story developer Telltale Games delivers. Since episode one, the team has talked about your choices creating your game on a relationship level, but there's an emotional context to all of this, too. Sure, Kenny will still give me crap for siding with Lilly back in the meat locker, but I love the guy as he's always had my back. Maybe you don't because of a choice or fight you had with him, but I do. In my playthrough, these guys are bros.\n\nLong Road Ahead strains the personal narrative I\u2019ve built, fracturing the web of relationships established over four hours. Telltale built these foundations, and now it's testing them. It's infinitely exciting if not extremely depressing at times.\n\nAs usual, the game looks sharp with its bold lines and comic-style art, and the voice acting is above reproach. These two facets really allow you to get lost in the story and notice Lee's pet name for Clem, Duck actually being useful, and Lilly's grief. But, also as usual, the game can stutter in the framerate department.

{"game": "Rock Band Blitz", "index": 35, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/rock-band-blitz/xbox-360-131273", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/27/rock-band-blitz-review", "review": "Music games are dead -- at least as we've known them since 2005. Plastic guitars sit on closet floors around the world, Rock of the Dead 2 is nowhere in sight, and even Activision was like, \"OK, we'll stop shoving Guitar Hero down your throat.\" But Rock Band Blitz proves that not every game revolving around music needs to be banished to the Island of Misfit Toys. With fast, challenging gameplay, the $14.99 download's focus on high scores should get you and your friends list bopping to the music on your hard drive once again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than plug in all those unloved instruments, Rock Band Blitz takes the franchise's note highways and connects them to your controller. You use the shoulder buttons to cycle through the drum, guitar, bass, mic and keyboard highways, and then tap the D-pad and a face button to play the descending notes. (Rock Band Blitz actually supports a number of control options, so feel free to just use the joysticks or whatever to play.)\n\n poilib start \n\nAnd therein lies the rub: Rock Band Blitz is a pretty hardcore game if you want it to be.\n\n poilib end  The setup is a lot like PS2's Amplitude, PSP's Rock Band Unplugged and Rock Band 3 on the DS -- if you've never played a music game like this, you're missing out. Playing Rock Band Blitz is fun even if you're cursing yourself for missing a long note you had no business missing. The notes are coming no matter what, so you have to be quick on the trigger and willing to jump around to master every track. When you're on a roll, it's easy to feel like god's gift to gaming.\n\nEven if you suck at rhythm games, you'll get your rock star moment as you can't fail out of Rock Band Blitz. No matter how terrible you're doing, the song keeps going. Your only concern is getting the highest score you can, so you're trying to nail the notes in order to score points and keep each highway's individual multiplier growing.\n\nMultipliers are one of the big tweaks developer Harmonix has brought to the gameplay of Blitz. When you hit the prerequisite number of notes on a given track, you raise its multiplier. However you can only raise it by so many in a given section of a song. Cross a checkpoint, and the max multiplier will increase giving you a new ceiling to shoot for -- but your ceiling only increases as much as your lowest track multiplier.\n\nIf it sounds confusing in explanation, you just need to play a song to get the gist. If you have all your highways at 4x except for a 2x microphone track, you're only going to have a max of 5x for the next section of the song because 2x is only one away from the lowest multiplier.\n\nThis system is equal parts ZOMG excitement and the frustration of hindsight. I love jumping between my tracks and trying to get everyone to the temporary ceiling, but how many times did I ignore a vocal track for too long only to not have enough notes to get it whipped into shape before the checkpoint? (The answer is: a lot.) To truly succeed in Rock Band Blitz, you need an intimate knowledge of the songs so that you've concurred the minimal keyboard notes before a bass solo takes you to a checkpoint.\n\n poilib start \n\nRock Band Blitz is doing for Elton John songs what Pac-Man Championship Edition DX did for pellets.\n\n poilib end  And therein lies the rub: Rock Band Blitz is a pretty hardcore game if you want it to be. Yes, there are pretty colors and poppy songs to entertain your roommate with, but when he goes to bed, you can sit there and nitpick your performance to death because the game is all about high scores. Before you even launch into a session, you're presented with a song's leaderboard so that you can see how your friends did. When you're playing the song, a meter on the side shows you how your friends were doing at the exact point you're at. When you're done, you can fire off Score War challenges to online buds.\n\nRock Band Blitz is doing for Elton John songs what Pac-Man Championship Edition DX did for pellets. No matter how good you're doing, there's some way to milk Rock Band Blitz songs for more points, and that's rather ingenious. The game isn't about making music, it's about making a place for yourself on the leaderboards.\n\nKnowing that, allow power-ups to change everything. As you knock out songs, you're earning Blitz Cred and coins. Blitz Cred is the game's experience system, and as you hit milestones, you unlock power-ups such as double points for bass notes and bomb notes that clear off surrounding highways. Before launching into a jam session, you can equip three power-ups, but each time you use a power-up, it costs you coins.\n\nYou might see that I crushed Stephen and the Colberts' \"Charlene (I'm Right Behind You),\" but when you try it, you can't get close to my score. You'll need to tinker with power-ups to find the combo that gives you the edge. On the flip side, I might see you embarrass me at a beloved Weezer song, but seeing as I'm fresh out of coins, I need to go farm some by playing Boston's catalog. Rock Band Blitz is pretty great at keeping you playing and -- if you dig the formula -- loving every minute of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy problem is that I wish Rock Band Blitz called out to be played. You can link the game with your Facebook so that Score Wars are just a click away, but I'd rather a message to my console told me KingTut33 beat me at The Police's \"Can't Stand Losing You.\" When I turn on my video game machine, I want updates about my video games -- not when I'm trying to figure out if those two people from high school are still married.\u00a0From a single-player perspective, I always loved building a band in Rock Band Unplugged, and that's not in Blitz. That carrot on the end of the stick would've been nice, especially for players without Rock Band-lovin' friends.\n\nI did notice some\u00a0framerate issues when Rock band Blitz got super-colorful and jampacked with notes, but for the most part the game ran well.\n\nI've mentioned a lot of different bands in this review, but it's important to point out that Rock Band Blitz only comes with 25 songs, and as it's a hodgepodge trying to have something for everyone, the list is all over the place, which I dig but I know some who don't. However, all Rock Band downloadable content is compatible with Rock Band Blitz. So if you're like me and religiously bought tracks for the few years when music games were the bee's knees, you've got a hard drive full of Rock Band Blitz goodies. And if you skipped the music game craze, the Rock Band store is bursting with tunes to make you happy. Plus, once you buy Blitz, the new 25 songs can then be played in Rock Band 3 with its plastic\u00a0instruments\u00a0and such.\n\nRock Band Blitz is great. The core gameplay will keep you switching and tapping like a madman or woman, and the inability to fail allows anyone to get excited and enjoy the experience. Once you master that, the high scores and bragging rights will call your name and get their hooks in if you're that type of gamer. However, if you're not of the high score chasin' mentality, Rock Band Blitz might be an obsession that passes you by as there's no real draw for solo shenanigans.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive", "index": 36, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-global-offensive/mac-116695", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/28/counter-strike-global-offensive-review", "review": "Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend\u00a0a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.\n\nGrowth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you\u2019re a Call of Duty player, you\u2019re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it\u2019s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.\n\nPieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.\n\nEven in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn\u2019t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.\n\nIf you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.\n\n poilib start \n\nThere's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back.\n\n poilib end  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas \u2013 entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location \u2013 but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.\n\nArms Race can get out of control, but patience pays off.\n\nUnlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.\n\nIf you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits:\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nFor those who want to play on PlayStation 3 but don\u2019t want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks, Counter-Strike: GO supports mouse and keyboard, giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the Xbox 360 version. If you\u2019re feeling saucy, Move is another option, although nuance dies with the motion controller. Move is accurate, and your quick reflexes will score kills, but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble. Worse, moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller, which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic left/right looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees.  poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nAside from the lack of keyboard/mouse input, the Xbox 360 version of Global Offensive is functionally identical to that on PS3 -- the new radial user-interface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on PC. Because it\u2019s a hardcore competitive game, Counter-Strike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating, forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the Wild West of obscenity that is Xbox Live.\n\nGlobal Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Worms Revolution", "index": 37, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/worms-revolution/ps3-131184", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/03/worms-revolution-review", "review": "For 17 years now, Team17 has been pitting worms against one another in deadly warfare. Oh sure, the presentation has always been colourful, and the tone comedic, but make no mistake, victory on this battlefield requires skill and tactical nous. Worms has always been something of a sandbox experience at its core, you see. Two or more teams of worms are randomly positioned on a map, each with the same toolbox of weapons and items. The gameplay is turn-based, with each player having a short amount of time to move one or more of their forces and attempt to take out the opposition. Making the most of each move is easier said than done.\n\nSo that\u2019s the boring, clinical way of putting it. A more evocatively-minded reviewer would no doubt describe a series of gameplay snapshots: worms in jetpacks dropping sticks of dynamite on enemy heads; hand grenades setting off chain reactions of explosive barrels which then rain napalm down onto survivors; super-weapons destroying huge chunks of the environment; rockets arcing across the map; near-dead worms teleporting to safety or retreating into the earth; worms ninja roping across caverns; uzis spraying; shotguns blasting; old ladies, erm, exploding; concrete donkeys\u2026 doing massive damage.\n\nShame I\u2019m not more evocatively-minded. And yes, you did read that right \u2013 ninja ropes.\n\nThat&#Array;s one nasty donkey punch.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s a reason Worms has been such an enduring part of the gaming landscape. It\u2019s a fantastic series. There\u2019s also a reason that it settled back into 2D after its flirtation with 3D gameplay. These battlefields must be readable at a glance; they need to be presented cleanly, so that players can focus on how best to use the environment and their remaining cache of weapons and abilities. When things go horribly, comically wrong \u2013 as they regularly do \u2013 the chain of events has to be clear.\n\nSo what does Revolution bring to the table? A fair bit, actually. First up, battlefields now feature physics objects, like zippo lighters, glass flasks etc. These can be moved around with certain abilities (such as telekinesis) and after taking enough damage will either explode or release noxious gas/water, or both. Repositioning them is generally more trouble than it\u2019s worth, however, while damage they\u2019ve taken isn\u2019t as clearly communicated as it could be. It\u2019s also frustrating that, say, a tin of lighter fluid or a glass flask can absorb a direct hit from a bazooka. Greater fragility might have made these objects more fun.\n\nDynamic water has also been introduced to battlefields, letting players do things like blasting a hole in a pocket of water to send it cascading into the map, hopefully washing away some enemy worms in the process. Worms that are underwater take damage every turn, but can use new utilities like the plug hole to drain the liquid. It\u2019s a fun idea, but weapons like the water pistol, water bomb and water strike are harder to use effectively than more traditional weapons, and just don\u2019t have the same oomph.\n\nThe biggest change to the series, however, is the introduction of classes. The basic worm is now known as the Soldier, and he\u2019s joined by the Scout, Scientist and Heavy. The differences are immediately noticeable. Scouts are far more agile than any other class, for instance, moving faster and jumping further. They\u2019re also more responsive to control when jetpacking, can fall greater distances without taking damage and even have other perks like longer reach with their ninja ropes. On the flipside, they do the least damage with their attacks and are lighter, so are knocked around a whole lot more. poilib start \n\nThe biggest change is the introduction of classes. The basic worm is now known as the Soldier, and he\u2019s joined by the Scout, Scientist and Heavy.\n\n poilib end \n\nAs you\u2019d imagine, the heavies are the flipside to that \u2013 these guys are tanks. They move slowly and can\u2019t jump to save their lives, but can deal and absorb more damage. The scientists are the support class. Each time it\u2019s a scientist\u2019s turn, everyone on the team gets an additional five points of health, and defensive weapons like sentry guns and electromagnets are more powerful if created by a scientist.\n\nIncluding classes obviously gives Revolution additional tactical variety that previous titles didn\u2019t have, and this definitely comes into play during the single player missions, where the player\u2019s resources are fixed. These missions \u2013 particularly later in the campaign \u2013 pit the player against large numbers of enemy worms, and sometimes having the extra agility of the scout in your formation can make all the difference. Run out of ninja ropes and jetpacks? Scouts can often make the jumps that other worms can\u2019t, and get into a good position to do damage.\n\nThat said, every new class has significant weaknesses, so I only really found it worthwhile varying my squad up when a level was giving me particular trouble. I\u2019m also not a huge fan of the heavies. Deft movement and careful positioning of your worms is key in this series, and these guys are just too sluggish to bother moving over anything but flat ground. And even then it\u2019s achingly slow. Of course, if you\u2019re teleporting your worms in at the start of a multiplayer round, they can be hugely valuable, but otherwise bad positioning can effectively damn the heavy, given how important mobility is.\n\nNot the most creative of names, but hey, at least you won&#Array;t get the classes confused.\n\nEven so, I do think the classes are a good inclusion, particularly as you can take them or leave them. They\u2019re a bonus atop traditional Worms awesomeness. And as alluded to, they can really shake up multiplayer. Scout versus scout battles are a blast, as these guys just feel fantastic to move about, resulting in a more dynamic battlefield.\n\nBefore we talk more about multiplayer, however, I\u2019ll just touch on the single player component. It\u2019s nice and meaty for the price, with 32 campaign levels and 20 puzzle levels, spread across four settings. Worms veterans will breeze through at least the first half of both, but there\u2019s some serious challenge on the home stretch. For my money the later campaign levels are a little too punitive, as players must make the most of very scarce resources, but are still subject to the whims of the (occasionally preternaturally gifted) A.I. and chance. These games give players less room for individual style, and thus feel a lot less like a sandbox. Coin crate drops \u2013 so players can buy additional weapons/utilities - would have been a good compromise to open these levels up a little.\n\nEven so, the single player component is solid, and the narration by Matt Berry (of Mighty Boosh, IT Crowd and Snuff Box fame) is priceless. He really should do every video game voiceover. Whisky!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s in multiplayer that Worms \u2013\u00a0as a franchise - comes into its own. As in previous titles, the worm customisation options let players edit names, choose soundboards, set accoutrements and so on, but it\u2019s really all about the game settings. Players can go in and tweak every aspect of the arsenal. Want one of everything? You can do that. Want infinite ninja ropes and Holy Hand Grenades? No problem. Want to set how many turns players have to wait before something is available? Yup, got it.\n\nIn addition to that, players can specify round times, turn times, starting health, retreat time and how sudden death works. They can turn fall damage on or off, they can specify how many swings worms can take on the ninja rope and whether worms teleport in at the start of a round. Percentage drop rates can be set for weapon, utility, health and coin crates, as can mine density in a level, as well as how long the fuse will be and whether dud mines are on or off. On top of that there\u2019s a great deal of control over the physical layout of the maps themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a fantastic set of options, even if the modes themselves aren\u2019t too out of the ordinary, with classic, deathmatch and fort to choose from. The differences? Deathmatch incorporates all the new elements like classes, water and physics objects that aren\u2019t in classic, while fort separates the teams across two island forts.\n\nShould you get Worms Revolution? Well, if you\u2019re a lapsed Worms player like myself, then absolutely. It\u2019s the same classic Worms gameplay with (optional) gameplay tweaks and a lovely new coat of paint.

{"game": "Worms Revolution", "index": 38, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/worms-revolution/pc-131183", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/03/worms-revolution-review", "review": "For 17 years now, Team17 has been pitting worms against one another in deadly warfare. Oh sure, the presentation has always been colourful, and the tone comedic, but make no mistake, victory on this battlefield requires skill and tactical nous. Worms has always been something of a sandbox experience at its core, you see. Two or more teams of worms are randomly positioned on a map, each with the same toolbox of weapons and items. The gameplay is turn-based, with each player having a short amount of time to move one or more of their forces and attempt to take out the opposition. Making the most of each move is easier said than done.\n\nSo that\u2019s the boring, clinical way of putting it. A more evocatively-minded reviewer would no doubt describe a series of gameplay snapshots: worms in jetpacks dropping sticks of dynamite on enemy heads; hand grenades setting off chain reactions of explosive barrels which then rain napalm down onto survivors; super-weapons destroying huge chunks of the environment; rockets arcing across the map; near-dead worms teleporting to safety or retreating into the earth; worms ninja roping across caverns; uzis spraying; shotguns blasting; old ladies, erm, exploding; concrete donkeys\u2026 doing massive damage.\n\nShame I\u2019m not more evocatively-minded. And yes, you did read that right \u2013 ninja ropes.\n\nThat&#Array;s one nasty donkey punch.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s a reason Worms has been such an enduring part of the gaming landscape. It\u2019s a fantastic series. There\u2019s also a reason that it settled back into 2D after its flirtation with 3D gameplay. These battlefields must be readable at a glance; they need to be presented cleanly, so that players can focus on how best to use the environment and their remaining cache of weapons and abilities. When things go horribly, comically wrong \u2013 as they regularly do \u2013 the chain of events has to be clear.\n\nSo what does Revolution bring to the table? A fair bit, actually. First up, battlefields now feature physics objects, like zippo lighters, glass flasks etc. These can be moved around with certain abilities (such as telekinesis) and after taking enough damage will either explode or release noxious gas/water, or both. Repositioning them is generally more trouble than it\u2019s worth, however, while damage they\u2019ve taken isn\u2019t as clearly communicated as it could be. It\u2019s also frustrating that, say, a tin of lighter fluid or a glass flask can absorb a direct hit from a bazooka. Greater fragility might have made these objects more fun.\n\nDynamic water has also been introduced to battlefields, letting players do things like blasting a hole in a pocket of water to send it cascading into the map, hopefully washing away some enemy worms in the process. Worms that are underwater take damage every turn, but can use new utilities like the plug hole to drain the liquid. It\u2019s a fun idea, but weapons like the water pistol, water bomb and water strike are harder to use effectively than more traditional weapons, and just don\u2019t have the same oomph.\n\nThe biggest change to the series, however, is the introduction of classes. The basic worm is now known as the Soldier, and he\u2019s joined by the Scout, Scientist and Heavy. The differences are immediately noticeable. Scouts are far more agile than any other class, for instance, moving faster and jumping further. They\u2019re also more responsive to control when jetpacking, can fall greater distances without taking damage and even have other perks like longer reach with their ninja ropes. On the flipside, they do the least damage with their attacks and are lighter, so are knocked around a whole lot more. poilib start \n\nThe biggest change is the introduction of classes. The basic worm is now known as the Soldier, and he\u2019s joined by the Scout, Scientist and Heavy.\n\n poilib end \n\nAs you\u2019d imagine, the heavies are the flipside to that \u2013 these guys are tanks. They move slowly and can\u2019t jump to save their lives, but can deal and absorb more damage. The scientists are the support class. Each time it\u2019s a scientist\u2019s turn, everyone on the team gets an additional five points of health, and defensive weapons like sentry guns and electromagnets are more powerful if created by a scientist.\n\nIncluding classes obviously gives Revolution additional tactical variety that previous titles didn\u2019t have, and this definitely comes into play during the single player missions, where the player\u2019s resources are fixed. These missions \u2013 particularly later in the campaign \u2013 pit the player against large numbers of enemy worms, and sometimes having the extra agility of the scout in your formation can make all the difference. Run out of ninja ropes and jetpacks? Scouts can often make the jumps that other worms can\u2019t, and get into a good position to do damage.\n\nThat said, every new class has significant weaknesses, so I only really found it worthwhile varying my squad up when a level was giving me particular trouble. I\u2019m also not a huge fan of the heavies. Deft movement and careful positioning of your worms is key in this series, and these guys are just too sluggish to bother moving over anything but flat ground. And even then it\u2019s achingly slow. Of course, if you\u2019re teleporting your worms in at the start of a multiplayer round, they can be hugely valuable, but otherwise bad positioning can effectively damn the heavy, given how important mobility is.\n\nNot the most creative of names, but hey, at least you won&#Array;t get the classes confused.\n\nEven so, I do think the classes are a good inclusion, particularly as you can take them or leave them. They\u2019re a bonus atop traditional Worms awesomeness. And as alluded to, they can really shake up multiplayer. Scout versus scout battles are a blast, as these guys just feel fantastic to move about, resulting in a more dynamic battlefield.\n\nBefore we talk more about multiplayer, however, I\u2019ll just touch on the single player component. It\u2019s nice and meaty for the price, with 32 campaign levels and 20 puzzle levels, spread across four settings. Worms veterans will breeze through at least the first half of both, but there\u2019s some serious challenge on the home stretch. For my money the later campaign levels are a little too punitive, as players must make the most of very scarce resources, but are still subject to the whims of the (occasionally preternaturally gifted) A.I. and chance. These games give players less room for individual style, and thus feel a lot less like a sandbox. Coin crate drops \u2013 so players can buy additional weapons/utilities - would have been a good compromise to open these levels up a little.\n\nEven so, the single player component is solid, and the narration by Matt Berry (of Mighty Boosh, IT Crowd and Snuff Box fame) is priceless. He really should do every video game voiceover. Whisky!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s in multiplayer that Worms \u2013\u00a0as a franchise - comes into its own. As in previous titles, the worm customisation options let players edit names, choose soundboards, set accoutrements and so on, but it\u2019s really all about the game settings. Players can go in and tweak every aspect of the arsenal. Want one of everything? You can do that. Want infinite ninja ropes and Holy Hand Grenades? No problem. Want to set how many turns players have to wait before something is available? Yup, got it.\n\nIn addition to that, players can specify round times, turn times, starting health, retreat time and how sudden death works. They can turn fall damage on or off, they can specify how many swings worms can take on the ninja rope and whether worms teleport in at the start of a round. Percentage drop rates can be set for weapon, utility, health and coin crates, as can mine density in a level, as well as how long the fuse will be and whether dud mines are on or off. On top of that there\u2019s a great deal of control over the physical layout of the maps themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a fantastic set of options, even if the modes themselves aren\u2019t too out of the ordinary, with classic, deathmatch and fort to choose from. The differences? Deathmatch incorporates all the new elements like classes, water and physics objects that aren\u2019t in classic, while fort separates the teams across two island forts.\n\nShould you get Worms Revolution? Well, if you\u2019re a lapsed Worms player like myself, then absolutely. It\u2019s the same classic Worms gameplay with (optional) gameplay tweaks and a lovely new coat of paint. If you\u2019re a die-hard fan, then the classes add a new element to multiplayer competition, and make the customisation options even more robust. All told, this is a great game for a great price.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

At times it very much embraces its old school heritage, pitting its heroes against horrific creatures in the darkest, filthiest locales imaginable. Tension is palpable thanks to production values that reach new heights for the franchise. Yet it simultaneously attempts to be the largest, most action-packed entry in its history, betraying the aforementioned strengths. Lengthy firefights, driving sequences and other ill-conceived ideas grind the game's incredible moments to a halt. The result is something erratic and never sure of itself, delivering brilliance one moment and something far less interesting the next.\n\nAt the heart of Resident Evil 6 are the game\u2019s four campaigns and seven lead characters. Rather than weaving these characters and stories along a singular campaign, Capcom diffuses them across four individual threads, each with its own beginning and end. This singular choice defines everything about this game, highlighting both its greatest accomplishments and remarkable shortcomings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResident Evil 6\u2019s over-the-top world is built piece-by-piece through its four storylines, which cleverly integrate with each other. Questions aren\u2019t necessarily answered until the entire plot emerges through different perspectives, and the realization that the game\u2019s designers deliberately held something back to unleash it during a later campaign makes the effort of pushing through four individual campaigns worth it. It\u2019s remarkable to enter a scene, realize its place in the larger timeline, and get a payoff for something that was merely hinted at during an entirely different character arc. There\u2019s a cumulative narrative effect that occurs here, one that wouldn\u2019t be possible if Capcom chose a different path.\n\n poilib start \n\nResident Evil 6\u2019s over-the-top world is fundamentally built through its many storylines, which cleverly integrate with each other.\n\n poilib end  Every storyline in this game, through a combination of great environments, great enemies and a carefully cultivated sense of wide-eyed, B-movie horror, has situations so memorable that they\u2019ll be seared into your brain. It\u2019s hard to forget the first time you\u2019re crushed by the relentless, beastly Ustanak, or watch a creature spew out C-virus gas in a crowded area, turning dozens of trapped human survivors into flesh-eating zombies. These moments come frequently, often serving as vivid, gory reminders of the game\u2019s tense storytelling prowess.\n\nYet the layered narrative sometimes works against the gameplay. As the campaigns cross paths, the game forces players to replay sequences - including some lengthy encounters that really ought to be played once and only once. There is nothing gained from this repetition, as the only story revelations come from cutscenes and dialogue - not in-game action. A game that thrives on the stacked benefit of multiple perspectives manages to forget how that negatively impacts the actual experience of playing through encounters repeatedly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat notion of repetition shines light on the most basic element of Resident Evil 6\u2019s biggest shortcomings \u2013 it\u2019s actually too big. Each campaign in this game contains moments of sheer excellence, but these are dragged down by the poor design of others. Chris\u2019s spectacular confrontation with a massive snake in a shabby Chinese apartment is preceded and interrupted by lengthy, monotonous gunfights on rooftops and a rather uninteresting fight against a helicopter. Jake and Sherry escape and engage threats by riding motorcycles and snow mobiles, making their thrilling, futile attempts to stop the Nemesis-like Ustanak significantly less rewarding. This mix of highs and lows is not only confusing, it\u2019s downright frustrating.\n\n poilib start \n\nEach campaign in this game contains moments of sheer excellence, but these are dragged down by the poor design of others. \n\n poilib end  Early on, different types of gameplay and tones of horror are established for each campaign. When the game\u2019s design works within these core competencies, it is absolutely a great experience. The elimination of Chris\u2019s team by an overwhelming, reptilian threat. Jake and Sherry repeatedly fleeing from the Ustanak. Leon and Helena surviving the ravaged Tall Oaks or uncovering the twisted secrets of an underground laboratory. Ada attempting to solve elaborate, convoluted puzzles in the belly of a submarine. These experiences stand apart from each other while remaining true to the beating heart of the Resident Evil franchise in their own unique way.\n\nCapcom would have done itself a world of good by simply understanding these individual storylines do not exist in a vacuum and don\u2019t need to be the same in terms of volume or length. Rather than trying to force diversity into each campaign through blatantly protracted action sequences, the development teams should have understood the campaigns feel freshest if they maintain a sense of purpose. This is not the first title in the franchise to attempt \u201cnon-traditional experiences,\u201d like taking the helm of a vehicle, but by virtue of its scope, it becomes the most excessive offender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past 15 years, Resident Evil has created its fear through one central tenant - you have guns and possibly allies, but the creatures you face are so powerful that none of these odd-eveners matter. The mutant and militant J\u2019avo creatures more or less throw that out the window. Suddenly you\u2019re engaging in firefights with soldiers that have machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket launchers - plus helicopters and tanks. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen some of these in a Resident Evil game, but it\u2019s never been so pervasive. The implementation of a cover system and move-and-shoot controls add to this overall shift for the franchise, making it less about its core principles and more about trying to be something it\u2019s not.\n\n poilib start \n\nThis time, your ally will actually be useful, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources.\n\n poilib end  The game does offer vast improvements in terms of cooperative experience - online or off. Resident Evil 5 was notorious for its vacuous AI partner system. This time, your ally will actually be useful, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources. That\u2019s not to say the system is perfect. It\u2019s not uncommon for you to issue an order only to have it ignored, or to stand waiting at a door for what feels like an eternity while your partner is seemingly missing in action. Playing with a friend, who can now drop in and out of your game at any time, will solve some of this, but once again exposes the weaknesses of Capcom\u2019s buddy-focused direction for the Resident Evil franchise. Tense or terrifying moments give way to a feeling of safety with the added company. It\u2019s hard to worry about a threat when your buddy is just around the corner to save you.\n\nOther online additions feel superficial, particularly compared to the vast scope of the core campaign. Mercenaries Mode returns, allowing \u2018skill points\u2019 earned in its time- and score-based gameplay to be applied to its own unique upgrades, or to the core campaign\u2019s. Tying the two experiences together will certainly provide some incentive to some. Agent Hunt Mode, meanwhile, allows you to take on the role of an enemy in a random online player\u2019s game, but the implementation of enemy combat and camera control is so haphazard there\u2019s little point in indulging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of Capcom\u2019s greatest successes are more immediately noticeable thanks to some incredibly strong world, lighting, and creature design. Outside of the return of the franchise\u2019s iconic zombies, which are a bit faster and more capable than in past iterations, Resident Evil 6 features an all-new roster of monsters. This was a bold move, one that adds a much-needed element of unpredictability to the campaigns. In fact, some of these creations - like the zombie-spawning Lepotitsa, or relentless Rasklapanje - rank among some of the best designs and concepts in the history of the franchise - no small feat for a series famous for the quality of its enemies.\n\nAtmosphere is the essence of the Resident Evil series. A powerful environment, full of detail and depth, pulls you in, creating a sense of history and life while also amplifying the emotional reaction. There\u2019s a reason settings like the Spencer Mansion from the first Resident Evil or Rapture from Bioshock prove so memorable. Those games wouldn\u2019t be nearly as powerful without those locales. In fact much of their experience relies upon them. Resident Evil 6 has no shortage of these types of great set pieces, ranging from cities under siege to dark, vast catacombs to cramped, cluttered high-rises.\n\nThese aesthetics mostly succeed thanks to an emphasis on strong lighting effects. Serving as a stark contrast to Resident Evil 5\u2019s sun-soaked locales, this sequel often opts for much darker scenery, pushing the overall visual fidelity through an increased emphasis on shadows and moody illumination. The result is an experience that has an immediate impact on the player, but the increased lighting design does have some unfortunate consequences. Background objects, textures and NPCs often take a noticeable dip in quality, sometimes to the point of distraction. Yet as a whole, Resident Evil has rarely felt so alive.\n\nEvolution and ambition are only natural for a franchise as old as Resident Evil, as is the need to respect a long-lasting legacy and the fans that have come to appreciate it. But in trying to serve all masters, Resident Evil 6 loses focus and fails to accurately assess which of its elements are truly worthy of being included. When this game is at its height, it sets new standards for the series in every way. Unfortunately, there are no shortage of lows either, taking what could have been an excellent experience and making it something considerably lesser.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

There is nothing gained from this repetition, as the only story revelations come from cutscenes and dialogue - not in-game action. A game that thrives on the stacked benefit of multiple perspectives manages to forget how that negatively impacts the actual experience of playing through encounters repeatedly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat notion of repetition shines light on the most basic element of Resident Evil 6\u2019s biggest shortcomings \u2013 it\u2019s actually too big. Each campaign in this game contains moments of sheer excellence, but these are dragged down by the poor design of others. Chris\u2019s spectacular confrontation with a massive snake in a shabby Chinese apartment is preceded and interrupted by lengthy, monotonous gunfights on rooftops and a rather uninteresting fight against a helicopter. Jake and Sherry escape and engage threats by riding motorcycles and snow mobiles, making their thrilling, futile attempts to stop the Nemesis-like Ustanak significantly less rewarding. This mix of highs and lows is not only confusing, it\u2019s downright frustrating.\n\n poilib start \n\nEach campaign in this game contains moments of sheer excellence, but these are dragged down by the poor design of others. \n\n poilib end  Early on, different types of gameplay and tones of horror are established for each campaign. When the game\u2019s design works within these core competencies, it is absolutely a great experience. The elimination of Chris\u2019s team by an overwhelming, reptilian threat. Jake and Sherry repeatedly fleeing from the Ustanak. Leon and Helena surviving the ravaged Tall Oaks or uncovering the twisted secrets of an underground laboratory. Ada attempting to solve elaborate, convoluted puzzles in the belly of a submarine. These experiences stand apart from each other while remaining true to the beating heart of the Resident Evil franchise in their own unique way.\n\nCapcom would have done itself a world of good by simply understanding these individual storylines do not exist in a vacuum and don\u2019t need to be the same in terms of volume or length. Rather than trying to force diversity into each campaign through blatantly protracted action sequences, the development teams should have understood the campaigns feel freshest if they maintain a sense of purpose. This is not the first title in the franchise to attempt \u201cnon-traditional experiences,\u201d like taking the helm of a vehicle, but by virtue of its scope, it becomes the most excessive offender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past 15 years, Resident Evil has created its fear through one central tenant - you have guns and possibly allies, but the creatures you face are so powerful that none of these odd-eveners matter. The mutant and militant J\u2019avo creatures more or less throw that out the window. Suddenly you\u2019re engaging in firefights with soldiers that have machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket launchers - plus helicopters and tanks. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen some of these in a Resident Evil game, but it\u2019s never been so pervasive. The implementation of a cover system and move-and-shoot controls add to this overall shift for the franchise, making it less about its core principles and more about trying to be something it\u2019s not.\n\n poilib start \n\nThis time, your ally will actually be useful, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources.\n\n poilib end  The game does offer vast improvements in terms of cooperative experience - online or off. Resident Evil 5 was notorious for its vacuous AI partner system. This time, your ally will actually be useful, assisting you when necessary and not taking your resources. That\u2019s not to say the system is perfect. It\u2019s not uncommon for you to issue an order only to have it ignored, or to stand waiting at a door for what feels like an eternity while your partner is seemingly missing in action. Playing with a friend, who can now drop in and out of your game at any time, will solve some of this, but once again exposes the weaknesses of Capcom\u2019s buddy-focused direction for the Resident Evil franchise. Tense or terrifying moments give way to a feeling of safety with the added company. It\u2019s hard to worry about a threat when your buddy is just around the corner to save you.\n\nOther online additions feel superficial, particularly compared to the vast scope of the core campaign. Mercenaries Mode returns, allowing \u2018skill points\u2019 earned in its time- and score-based gameplay to be applied to its own unique upgrades, or to the core campaign\u2019s. Tying the two experiences together will certainly provide some incentive to some. Agent Hunt Mode, meanwhile, allows you to take on the role of an enemy in a random online player\u2019s game, but the implementation of enemy combat and camera control is so haphazard there\u2019s little point in indulging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of Capcom\u2019s greatest successes are more immediately noticeable thanks to some incredibly strong world, lighting, and creature design. Outside of the return of the franchise\u2019s iconic zombies, which are a bit faster and more capable than in past iterations, Resident Evil 6 features an all-new roster of monsters. This was a bold move, one that adds a much-needed element of unpredictability to the campaigns. In fact, some of these creations - like the zombie-spawning Lepotitsa, or relentless Rasklapanje - rank among some of the best designs and concepts in the history of the franchise - no small feat for a series famous for the quality of its enemies.\n\nAtmosphere is the essence of the Resident Evil series. A powerful environment, full of detail and depth, pulls you in, creating a sense of history and life while also amplifying the emotional reaction. There\u2019s a reason settings like the Spencer Mansion from the first Resident Evil or Rapture from Bioshock prove so memorable. Those games wouldn\u2019t be nearly as powerful without those locales. In fact much of their experience relies upon them. Resident Evil 6 has no shortage of these types of great set pieces, ranging from cities under siege to dark, vast catacombs to cramped, cluttered high-rises.\n\nThese aesthetics mostly succeed thanks to an emphasis on strong lighting effects. Serving as a stark contrast to Resident Evil 5\u2019s sun-soaked locales, this sequel often opts for much darker scenery, pushing the overall visual fidelity through an increased emphasis on shadows and moody illumination. The result is an experience that has an immediate impact on the player, but the increased lighting design does have some unfortunate consequences. Background objects, textures and NPCs often take a noticeable dip in quality, sometimes to the point of distraction. Yet as a whole, Resident Evil has rarely felt so alive.\n\nEvolution and ambition are only natural for a franchise as old as Resident Evil, as is the need to respect a long-lasting legacy and the fans that have come to appreciate it. But in trying to serve all masters, Resident Evil 6 loses focus and fails to accurately assess which of its elements are truly worthy of being included. When this game is at its height, it sets new standards for the series in every way. Unfortunately, there are no shortage of lows either, taking what could have been an excellent experience and making it something considerably lesser.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Shad'O", "index": 42, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/shado/pc-141293", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/28/shado-review", "review": "Making tower defense look gorgeous.\n\nWilliam, the main character of Shad\u2019O, looks more than a little like Max of Where The Wild Things Are in his yellow Pikachu-like getup, so it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the narrative behind the game itself feels like a dark children\u2019s book. And to be fair, there are plenty of wild things waiting in the titular shadows here, but the difference is that they have no intention of hoisting little William on their shoulders as they head to a wild rumpus. This, in fact, is Sendak\u2019s tale as it might be told by Stephen King: it\u2019s a tale of murky memories, a parable of finding comfort in the midst of a heap of broken images, and somewhere in the middle of all that, it somehow also manages to be a decent tower defense game.\n\nDecent is the key word here. Shad\u2019O is a game that you play for its experience rather than for the ingenuity of its mechanics, and it celebrates the genre\u2019s essentials rather than toying with ambitious experiments in the vein of Orcs Must Die. You can probably guess the basics. There\u2019s a goal to defend (your memory) and a portal that spawns a menagerie of nightmarish baddies, and the core gameplay centers on generating the means to slow and defeat said baddies as they lurch their way down one or more paths. The upgradeable and unlockable \u201ccompanions\u201d you place along the paths even feel familiar despite their cuddly patchwork designs; punchers slow enemies much like freeze rays in other games, for instance, and projectors bombard the nightmares with shafts of light like lasers. It all works competently for the most part, but the absence of hotkeys makes the act of selecting new companions for deployment with the mouse tougher than it should be.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen all these features in different clothes before, but Shad\u2019O makes some effort to distinguish itself through a thick fog of \u201cforgetfulness\u201d that hangs over every level and obscures almost all of the map, dissipating only when you place companions around the edges of the clear spots to reveal bite-sized portions of the path. It\u2019s a simple concept, but it adds a healthy dose of tension since you can only see the approach of the few enemies that are tall enough to look over the fog, and it forces you to give a little more thought to placing your companions for maximum effectiveness. (A pity, then, that a unit eventually clears up even this nod to variety.) Another welcome addition is WIlliam\u2019s ability to unlock spells using the residue from defeated enemies. Some cast buffs on all your companions, but my personal favorite caused damage to all the enemies on the screen, thus providing me with a second chance when a level wasn\u2019t going too well. If there\u2019s a problem with the spells, it\u2019s that powering them disrupts the flow of gameplay as you need to run your mouse over the residue to collect it much as you would with coins in a standard Facebook farming game.\n\nDespite these attempts at variety, Shad\u2019O\u2019s rote adherence to the tower defense boilerplate taints extended playthroughs with the boredom of repetition, even with levels that add some twists to the experience. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t plenty of challenges in store here--Shad\u2019O gets difficult quickly, and you can test your skills against a level\u2019s \u201cnightmare\u201d mode once you\u2019ve beaten it--but its primary appeal rests in the richness of its visuals and the moody urgency of its music. Indeed, Shad\u2019O is a beautiful, inspiring game that stirred my emotions and once raised the hairs on the back of my neck, which much be a first for the tower defense genre. There\u2019s a psychedelic Escher-meets-Dali vibe to most of the backdrops that invites constant and close inspection, and the nightmare creatures themselves manage to simultaneously exude family friendliness and horror. It's a haunting tale, filled with mysterious illustrated stills of blurry hospital hallways and sad faces looking down on William as though from above a grave, and the mounting desperation oozes from each line and transition. This markedly unique sensory experience extends to the gameplay itself, which drapes the familiar tower defense routine in a creepy but powerful score and heralds the arrival of new creatures with ghoulish bellows in the gloom.The music, in fact, is easily Shad'O's best single feature, which makes an option to pick up the soundtrack for an extra two bucks all the more welcome. \n\nShad\u2019O is thus tower defense as art, and from a technical standpoint, the approach usually works. It\u2019s only jarring when you listen to the characters speak and read their accompanying subtitles, as the translation from French often looks as though the developers ran the script through Google Translate and called it a day. The voice acting only adds to the awkwardness thanks to the tendency of the actress (yes, actress) who plays William to place stresses on the wrong words, giving the unsettling impression that she was taught how to pronounce the words but not what they mean. To be fair, the bizarre syntax initially fits in well with the dreamlike ambiance of Shad\u2019O\u2019s early moments, but over time it shatters the poignancy of Shad\u2019O\u2019s weighty if minimalist narrative to the point that I found myself snickering when I suppose I should have been wallowing in bleak thoughts about the fickle nature of memory. The actor who voices William's teddy bear also does a phenomenal job despite the poor translation, achieving a near perfect combination of loving concern and frightened urgency that's as masterful as the music.\n\nShad\u2019O may not offer much in the way of new gameplay mechanics over the countless other tower defense games already available, but it distinguishes itself through its striking art design and compelling narrative. That won\u2019t be enough to entice players who have grown weary of the genre\u2019s conventions, but devoted fans who\u2019d enjoy sampling one of the best attempts to wedge a compelling story and sensory experience into standard tower defense gameplay will find a decent treat here. Its style may overshadow its substance, but there's enough here that you might find it doesn't matter in the end.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

And thus, we consumers are the ultimate winners. But what if your chief \u2013 and really, only \u2013 rival kept finding new and astounding ways to spin out, leaving you as the only car on the road? Would you kick back, ease off the gas a bit, and set the cruise control? Would you keep the pedal to the metal anyway? Or would you drop the top, start turning down new streets, and see where the open road takes you?\n\nNBA 2K13 unquestionably takes the latter path, lacing the latest version of its annual basketball simulation with wild features that, rest assured, take nothing away from the already stellar pro-hoops gameplay. Some of the new additions are great, while others you can live without, but, in the end, 2K13 is the pinnacle of basketball gaming on this generation of consoles.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\n2K13 has the cajones to mess with its tried-and-true simulation gameplay a bit. The pacing, flow, and feel all remain impeccable. The post-up game is not only playable but enjoyable. The big change is the right thumbstick-based Dribble Stick, which marries the Freestyle controls of last generation\u2019s NBA Live titles with the existing NBA 2K Isomotion control scheme. Shooting is now accomplished by pulling in LT/L2 in combination with a right stick directional press. It certainly takes getting used to given the years of shooting without an additional trigger pull, and odds are you will, like me, occasionally forget and fail to take a wide open shot you meant to attempt. But you\u2019ll eventually get used to it and grow to like the added dribble controls, as they\u2019re not nearly as arcade-y as they were in NBA Live\u2019s heyday, but still add an extra layer of player control to the gameplay.\n\n2K13\u2019s biggest problem \u2013 particularly with the Dribble Stick \u2013 is that none of its new features are explained well, if they\u2019re explained at all. You\u2019re never given a proper tutorial on the critical new dribble moves. Rather, the first time you start up the game, you\u2019re treated to a screen that essentially says, \u201cYou can control your dribble with the right stick now. Wiggle it and see what happens!\u201d So too are Signature Skills practically kept shrouded in secrecy unless you study the list of them in the main menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignature Skills assign star players up to several of a couple dozen \u201cplus\u201d traits, be it Corner Specialist (added accuracy when shooting threes from the corners), Finisher (better chance of making shots with defender contact), etc. Because they\u2019re passive and mostly invisible, you probably won\u2019t notice them unless you play MyCareer, where you\u2019ll spend your VC points \u2013 credits earned for anything you do in the game \u2013 to add them to your budding pro baller.\n\nSpeaking of which, the series\u2019 interface continues to be an archaic, convoluted mess. Some menus can\u2019t be backed out of, while save screens stupidly leave you at the save menu even after you\u2019re done saving \u2013 rather than taking you back to a menu where you can actually do something. Better to enjoy 2K13\u2019s commendable gameplay and suffer through a poorly designed interface than vice versa, but still, how many years has it been like this now?\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nYes, I did in fact invoke Justin Bieber\u2019s name in the context of a basketball video game review. And it\u2019s not a joke. The teen pop star leads a 2K13 Celebrity team that includes JB Smoove, Bow Wow, and others. They\u2019ve got a ridiculous 97 team rating, and so you can take the 1992 Dream Team \u2013 a glorious addition \u2013 head-on and give them a run for their money, as odd and completely impossible as that sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, MyPlayer has taken on a slightly more personal, RPG-like role. It\u2019s as engaging as last year, with your custom baller able to participate in a rookie game, get drafted (complete with a David Stern handshake at the podium), and develop your skills with experience. But now you can even request sit-downs with your general manager, in which you\u2019re free to be good (i.e. compliment the organization) or evil (request that your coach be fired). Your choice of words can be hilarious, and depending on what you say, your standing amongst your teammates, the media, and the fans will be positively or negatively affected.\n\nOn the Xbox 360 side, there\u2019s even Kinect voice support. It proves most useful for substitutions; just say, \u201cBring in Bryant\u201d and you\u2019ll see Kobe get up off the bench and head to the scorer\u2019s table to check in at the next dead ball. I couldn\u2019t, however, get a technical foul called on myself no matter how off-the-handle I flew after a questionable foul call.\n\nAh yes, and I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Jay Z \u2013 particularly since his name is in large font on both the front of the box and the main menu title screen. The Brooklyn Nets owner is credited as the game\u2019s executive producer, and, like Bieber, his presence is also not a joke. The soundtrack is of Hova\u2019s choosing, and while I won\u2019t go so far as to say it actively makes the game better, it certainly fits. What does make 2K13 legitimately better is Jay\u2019s pre-game intro packages, which mix music videos with slick gameplay footage to get you hyped up. It works \u2013 these impressively produced segments lend each on-court match an added importance and enthusiasm.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nThe NBA 2K series is also slowly evolving into a virtual hoops museum, too. Not only are NBA Legends teams like Jordan\u2019s dynasty-era Bulls, Magic\u2019s Lakers, Bird\u2019s Celtics, and now Iverson\u2019s 2000 76ers in the game, but so too are both the 2012 gold medal-winning Team USA basketball squad and the original 1992 Dream Team. Even Charles Barkley \u2013 who hasn\u2019t licensed his likeness to a video game since the Sega Genesis days \u2013 signed up. It\u2019s an appealing inclusion, though it begs for a full-blown Olympic tournament mode for both the 1992 and 2012 Summer Games.\n\nEven if you ignore 2K13\u2019s weird sideshows and look past its convoluted menus, its core beats with the heart of a champion. With such smooth, realistic gameplay held together by truly astounding presentation \u2013 meaning Jay Z\u2019s intros, the series\u2019 dead-on perfect animations, and note-perfect commentary \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to love and appreciate NBA 2K13 if you have any affinity for pro basketball whatsoever.\n\nIt\u2019s both scary and exciting to think how good a game we might get if NBA 2K actually had a serious competitor pushing it to new heights. But even when left with a clear, unobstructed path to the basket, 2K13 throws down a monster jam with this year\u2019s edition \u2013 probably the last one developed solely for this generation of consoles. It\u2019s obviously the best hoops game out there, and it might even be the best sports game of all, period.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend\u00a0a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.\n\nGrowth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you\u2019re a Call of Duty player, you\u2019re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it\u2019s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.\n\nPieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.\n\nEven in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn\u2019t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.\n\nIf you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.\n\n poilib start \n\nThere's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back.\n\n poilib end  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas \u2013 entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location \u2013 but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.\n\nArms Race can get out of control, but patience pays off.\n\nUnlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.\n\nIf you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits:\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nFor those who want to play on PlayStation 3 but don\u2019t want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks, Counter-Strike: GO supports mouse and keyboard, giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the Xbox 360 version. If you\u2019re feeling saucy, Move is another option, although nuance dies with the motion controller. Move is accurate, and your quick reflexes will score kills, but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble. Worse, moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller, which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic left/right looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees.  poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nAside from the lack of keyboard/mouse input, the Xbox 360 version of Global Offensive is functionally identical to that on PS3 -- the new radial user-interface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on PC. Because it\u2019s a hardcore competitive game, Counter-Strike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating, forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the Wild West of obscenity that is Xbox Live.\n\nGlobal Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.\n\nPieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.\n\nEven in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn\u2019t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill.

There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.\n\nIf you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike.

{"game": "Hoodwink", "index": 50, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/hoodwink/pc-136672", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/23/hoodwink-review", "review": "A dystopian world where gun-toting anthropomorphs, recycled human brains plunked down onto metal robot bodies, and hippy rebels all co-exist under the oppressive thumb of a trigger-happy pharmaceutical company sounds like a neat setting to dig into. It could be, really, except Hoodwink totally botches its inherent potential from the get-go. Almost every major step of the way in this insipid, barely hour-long point-and-click adventure feels like a lesson in how not to design a game.\n\nNavigating Hoodwink's story might be a lot more enjoyable if it made some modicum of sense. Roguish protagonist Michael Bezzle (M. Bezzle)'s adventure kicks off with a night out on the town to pilfer the items he needs to propose to his girlfriend Francesca. Most of your time spent fiddling around with rote fetch quests in the dirty slums of Global-1 is dedicated to this seemingly mundane quest, yet sporadic encounters with a cat-detective and the comically oafish UniCorp troops hint at bigger matters afoot. Wisps of frayed plot threads pop-up along the way, but none of them really come together to explain or intrigue. This total lack of cohesiveness comes to a head at the awkwardly-placed cliffhanger ending that does precious little to inspire me to play a sequel in order to find out what the heck is going on, assuming one ever gets made.\n\nIt doesn't help that things get off to a rough start. The impact of the clever narrative slight-of-hand that unfolds in the opening scene introducing Michael is lost amidst some of the most unwieldy point-and-click controls I've encountered in a long time. Simply moving around to access specific areas of the screen and interacting with objects is a constant wrestling match. Changing the camera angle and transitioning between areas is triggered by clicking vague hotspots around the environment, rather than walking over to where you want to go. While this will sound familiar to adventure gaming vets, the way its implemented here just doesn't work that well.\n\nAfter I accidentally walked past a crucial puzzle hotspot sitting on the back wall following a brief cinematic, it took me several minutes of cursing and frantic trial-and-error clicking to figure how to get back there. I knew what I needed to do. The game just wouldn't let get there without a fight. This particular issue is less prevalent in the open areas found further along in the trek, but most forms of movement and interaction throughout Hoodwink's brief jaunt are awkward and sluggish at best -- and that's when they're not glitching out.\n\nIn several instances, using a staircase caused the camera to get stuck on the wrong floor, forcing me to restart the game from scratch. Wonky pathfinding also occasionally made Michael walk in the opposite direction of where I intended him to go before looping around to his destination in a bizarre roundabout way. These funky moments stand out among the more general feelings of frustration that set in when trying to get around.\n\nHoodwink's poorly conceived puzzles are far from inventive, and most boil down to fetching objects and bringing them to the obvious spot where they're needed. Some puzzle solutions are absurdly disconnected from their objective, like one early-on that has you hunting down matches, smoking a cigar, and cranking a machine on the wall to reveal the item you're hunting for. Others are either too basic to begin with or are ruined by the erratic hint system, which alternately tells you exactly what you need to do next or spits out vague leads. There's a rare instance or two where interactive mini-games have you turning cranks or catching bugs, but these tasks are tackled within seconds and add very little to the experience. It's not terribly hard to figure out what to do simple because there's barely anything to interact with in the environments to begin with.\n\nThe lack of puzzle creativity carries over into the one-dimensional characters that they frequently hinge upon too. Playful stereotypes abound, from the flower child hippie spouting \"stick it to The Man\" rhetoric to the agitated Asian food vendor peddling rat burgers in bad English, but they're more hokey than humorous. Dialogue alternates between cheesy and obnoxious too, and while some of the voice work is well done, most of it is overdone. All of this is a shame, because the cel-shaded artwork is really quite good, and the setting itself is an interesting place to explore. Unfortunately, everything else is pretty weak.\n\nThe cool art direction and quirky sci-fi world get squandered on some truly uninspired adventure gaming drudgery. The best part about a game shouldn't be the fact that it's over quickly. With an hour or so of dull, confusing point-and-click frustration that resembles an expensive tech demo rather than a full release, Hoodwink definitely lives up to its name.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

And really, do you need much else for a pair of games released in the 90s? If I can\u2019t get the sensation of plunking down a quarter on the machine to claim next game, I don\u2019t want anyone messing with my simple, yet brutal matchups. Though, if you know what you\u2019re doing, you may want to mess around with some of the technical options available to you, like establishing ping thresholds or your GGPO delay (translation: you can set exactly how much lag you\u2019re willing to put up with).\n\nIf you remember some really excellent looks, graphically, you\u2019d be remembering right as well. The thing about pixelated fighters is that they age much more gracefully than their polygonal counterparts. As long as characters and backgrounds are lovingly drawn and animated, it\u2019s hard to imagine them aging in ways that a lot of early-era 3D games have.\n\nThe handful of visual filters let you recreate the arcade feel in a wholly creative way...like the CRT mode!\n\nThe Vault is also rather neat.

Were most of your memories with Marvel vs. Capcom at home on a big ol\u2019 CRT TV? Turn on scan lines and get transported back to your childhood. Were you an arcade rat? Turn on the Retro look and the screen angles itself, just like an arcade cabinet.

Each tweak brings back wonderful memories for me, and anyone with a background in 90s fighting games will certainly feel the same.\n\nAs a history lesson, Marvel vs. Capcom Origins is a great experience. Both Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes and Marvel Super Heroes hold up surprisingly well. The love put into the collection is clear in the attention to faithfully reproducing exactly what made players fall in love with these games in the first place.

Just ask anyone with a marketing degree. But in the case of the Dead or Alive franchise, sex has been both a boon and a curse. After all, you can't create beach volleyball spinoffs or direct your ad campaign at oversexed college students if you want your franchise taken seriously.\n\nAt long last, the folks at Team Ninja have seen it too, and the result is Dead or Alive 5, a fighter that's far more interested in beating you down than getting you off. Thanks to a number of key tweaks and additions, the fighting system is deeper and more balanced than ever. Mix that with exciting interactive stages, gorgeous visuals, and a comprehensive feature set, and you get a package that can entertain everyone - from the Monday night button mashers to the exacting tournament pros.\n\n\"My eyes are up HERE!\"\n\nDuring my first hours with the game, I was consistently surprised by the all-inclusive package of features on offer. The ability to download and upload replays, Facebook integration, and online training sessions are just a few examples of how the overall experience has improved. But the real gem here is the insanely deep training mode, which provides players with more detailed information about their moves than they've ever had before. Everything from frame data to player states and move properties are relayed in real time, giving advanced players the kind of knowledge they need to intelligently develop their play style. Despite how much experience I have with the franchise, this training mode is teaching me things I never knew about characters I've played for years.\n\nThose gamers who play at the tournament level ask for such features all the time. Developer Team Ninja laudably includes them, along with a fully voiced story mode teeming with well-produced cutscenes and plot twists, and all the single player content DOA fans have come to expect. It's an exhaustive suite of bells and whistles that should satisfy both casual and serious fight fans alike.\n\nOf course, the most important thing is how the game feels. Don't worry, Dead or Alive 5\u2019s kung fu is strong indeed. As ever, the rock, paper, scissors game of strikes, holds, and throws is the core mechanic, putting the focus squarely on predicting or baiting a response from your opponent, only to crush them mercilessly with whatever beats it. It's a non-stop speed round of mind games, and nothing feels better than setting up shop in the other guy's head, making the right read at the right time, and dishing out huge punishment.

A more obvious example is the addition of a true sidestep \u2013 a series first. While DOA has always allowed full 3D movement, it was strictly for positioning. Now you can actually juke laterally at a moment's notice to avoid opponents' strikes and launch an immediate counter-offensive. Accordingly, every attack in the game has now been classed as \u201ctracking\u201d or \u201cnon-tracking\u201d to denote if it can follow a sidestep or not. This has been a core concept in nearly every other 3D fighter, and its absence in DOA has long been, for some, a source of ridicule for the franchise. By finally including it, players can now punish moves and score counter-hits in previously impossible ways, making the transitions between attack and defense even more dynamic.\n\nDenis Leary shoots the pilot for his next show.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Critical Burst attack opens up a slew of new offensive possibilities. In previous DOAs, a stunned opponent couldn't attack or block, but they could still escape with a counter hold. Thus, the only way to get guaranteed damage after a stun was to launch your victim and juggle. While counter holds have retained the ability to break stun, Critical Burst negates it, sinking your opponent into an inescapable stun that gives you all day to inflict maximum damage.\n\nThe importance of this simply cannot be overstated. Where before, a stunned foe could just predict your launcher and counter hold-out accordingly, now they have to guess between the launcher and the Critical Burst, making stuns true mix-up situations that you can more reliably convert into big combos. They also pave the way for the new Power Blow, a potent charged attack that you gain access to after dropping below 50% health. Land it and you get treated to a stylish, slow motion beatdown, often culminating in your opponent getting violently slammed into something that breaks or blows up.\n\nAnd let me tell you, there's a lot of stuff that breaks and blows up in these stages. Other fighting games have wall splats and ring outs, we've got train wrecks, Apache gunships, and tigers. Yes, tigers. The series has always had multi-tiered levels with destructible elements, but DOA5 takes it to a whole other level. Now more than ever, they can turn an everyday fight into an entertaining spectacle. Seeing a massive explosion from a car crash in the background after knocking an opponent down a 50-foot drop to street level is just too fun, and many stages house similarly spectacular moments.\n\n poilib start \n\nMany stages house spectacular moments.\n\n poilib end \n\nAs much of a visual treat as it is, it can also be a bit much at times...like when Hayate gets plowed into by a derailed train and doesn\u2019t die.

Still, they can feel like gimmicks, used to make the game more interesting to casual fight fans (a la gems in Street Fighter x Tekken). Thankfully, there's an option to turn off these danger zones, and plenty of stages don't have them at all, so if you want a more straightforward fighting experience, you can still have it.\n\nEven without these blockbuster moments, the stages are memorable and lovingly crafted.

That's not just any side kick, that's Lei Fang's side kick, and only Zack does a jumping double knee quite like he does.\n\nNever bet against the ninja.\n\nWith such a generous move list comprised mostly of punches and kicks, it's a wonder that hardly any two look or feel the same. Hit animations are almost as varied, with a huge assortment of different stuns and staggers adding impact to each landed blow. It's this constant payoff mixed with the responsive, simple controls that make Dead or Alive so maddeningly addictive. Every match looks like a well-choreographed kung-fu fight, and whether you know what you're doing or not, the results always look impressive.

No matter what character you play, no matter how bad the matchup is, the person who makes the better read wins. For every action, a reaction. Despite it being more over the top than Virtua Fighter, or less complex than Tekken, this simple fact has always made it a very satisfying game to play.\n\nDead or Alive 5 is, without any question, the best entry in the series. It retains its identity as a fast-paced, visually stunning 3D fighter, while shedding much of the baggage that's typically held it back. While there's still plenty of eye candy for both the ladies and gents, it's taken a back seat to what fighting games should be all about: fighting. It gives the casual fan a fighting experience that's as easy to grasp as it is exciting to watch, while providing more serious players the depth and features they need to stay interested. Give Dead or Alive 5 an honest chance, and you\u2019ll find a formidable, enormously entertaining fighter that will keep you busy for a long time to come. \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Just ask anyone with a marketing degree. But in the case of the Dead or Alive franchise, sex has been both a boon and a curse. After all, you can't create beach volleyball spinoffs or direct your ad campaign at oversexed college students if you want your franchise taken seriously.\n\nAt long last, the folks at Team Ninja have seen it too, and the result is Dead or Alive 5, a fighter that's far more interested in beating you down than getting you off. Thanks to a number of key tweaks and additions, the fighting system is deeper and more balanced than ever. Mix that with exciting interactive stages, gorgeous visuals, and a comprehensive feature set, and you get a package that can entertain everyone - from the Monday night button mashers to the exacting tournament pros.\n\n\"My eyes are up HERE!\"\n\nDuring my first hours with the game, I was consistently surprised by the all-inclusive package of features on offer. The ability to download and upload replays, Facebook integration, and online training sessions are just a few examples of how the overall experience has improved. But the real gem here is the insanely deep training mode, which provides players with more detailed information about their moves than they've ever had before. Everything from frame data to player states and move properties are relayed in real time, giving advanced players the kind of knowledge they need to intelligently develop their play style. Despite how much experience I have with the franchise, this training mode is teaching me things I never knew about characters I've played for years.\n\nThose gamers who play at the tournament level ask for such features all the time. Developer Team Ninja laudably includes them, along with a fully voiced story mode teeming with well-produced cutscenes and plot twists, and all the single player content DOA fans have come to expect. It's an exhaustive suite of bells and whistles that should satisfy both casual and serious fight fans alike.\n\nOf course, the most important thing is how the game feels. Don't worry, Dead or Alive 5\u2019s kung fu is strong indeed. As ever, the rock, paper, scissors game of strikes, holds, and throws is the core mechanic, putting the focus squarely on predicting or baiting a response from your opponent, only to crush them mercilessly with whatever beats it. It's a non-stop speed round of mind games, and nothing feels better than setting up shop in the other guy's head, making the right read at the right time, and dishing out huge punishment.

Such appeals to a player\u2019s humanity are bold but risky moves in a military shooter, where countless corpses of faceless terrorists pile up at your feet.\n\nWarfighter strives for this by giving you a genuine impression of what it\u2019s like to live as a Tier 1 operator, the elite operatives at the center of the modernized Medal of Honor series. It\u2019s clear from the first cutscene all the way to the end credits that developer Danger Close has the utmost respect for the extraordinary skills and bravery of these soldiers. If Medal of Honor extended the same level of respect to its players, Warfighter might have accomplished more than its numerous significant failures and lack of player agency has allowed.\n\nThis scene is so scripted you can finish it without touching a button.\n\nThe landscape of the first-person shooter is not the same as it once was. The 2010 series reboot was a competent mimicry of what had worked previously, and its sequel continues to ignore innovation. For the entirety of its brief five-hour campaign, Warfighter spotlights one tired design idea after the other. Each linear action sequence boils down to whack-a-mole with firearms: AI enemies mindlessly pop out from the same cover spots or stand out in the open just waiting to die. When they\u2019ve all been killed, your squad kicks down a door, kills a handful of evil terrorists in slow motion, and moves onto the next section of the predictable pattern. Warfighter leaves little room for strategic thinking, too, since it funnels your team down narrow paths by blocking alternative routes with rocks, bushes, or invisible walls.\n\n poilib start \n\nAn entire two-minute mission consists of taking a single shot you can\u2019t miss.\n\n poilib end  Much of Medal of Honor is out of your hands, stripping you of the satisfaction that comes with making a difference or any impact on the world in a meaningful way. Many doors don\u2019t open until allies let you through. Suspects you chase on foot conveniently wait when you fall behind. Choppers fly in to finish the job you couldn\u2019t, airstrikes level buildings in your way, and an entire two-minute mission consists of taking a single shot you can\u2019t miss. Hey, at least the weapons feel terrific, with bullets biting through enemies at an almost uncomfortable level of efficiency. Great firefights are par for the course in Frostbite Engine-powered games, and Medal of Honor feels as good as it looks. Warfighter\u2019s incredible attention to atmospheric environmental detail gives Battlefield 3 a run for its money, and establishes a sense of place where the level design can't.\n\nThe bare-bones mission design of Warfighter is entirely in service of its mantra, not its players. That is, Medal of Honor\u2019s campaign wants to throw you into situations \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s devastating to whatever story Warfighter fails to tell. The primary objective is buried by disjointed jumps from one character or country to the next \u2013 as it has been in Battlefield and Call of Duty as well. It\u2019s hard to keep the dots connected, too, because the timeline follows no discernible order and features flashbacks within flashbacks. The narrative of Warfighter\u2019s core revolves around the dissolution and rebuilding of an operator\u2019s family, but the characters and in-game events compromise pathos. How can anyone empathize with a broken man who spends the next few hours plunging a hatchet into hearts, snapping necks, and generally slaughtering hundreds of other people?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a massive disconnect between the story Danger Close wants to to tell and the game it\u2019s made, and both suffer because of each other. All of this leaves Warfighter as uninteresting as it is disengaged, and none of its promises pay off. This is equally true in the hollow multiplayer. Abysmal map design cripples the already uninspired objective-based modes, creating obstacles cutting off paths to a bomb site or a flag return point. Shrubbery and impassable rubble obscure routes, creating a dense clutter even in the biggest maps, while spawn camping is an intensely frustrating problem in nearly all modes.\n\n poilib start \n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen a Frostbite Engine game failing to function at a basic level.\n\n poilib end  A few variables on existing formulas make those multiplayer game types different from its contemporaries, but not in a substantial enough way to stand out above them. Hotspot constantly changes bomb-planting locations and Home Run forbids respawns during Capture the Flag \u2013 interesting twists, but other shooters, including Medal of Honor\u2019s sister series, Battlefield, have explored similar conventions better.\n\nLess exciting than it looks.\n\nEven Warfighter\u2019s class system is outdone by better multiplayer games. Each specialty has its own unique skills, such as the heavy\u2019s armor boost or the scout\u2019s ability to see through walls, but the customization of those characters is limited to their weapons. Streak bonuses unlock as you score points, giving you the choice between aggressive/defensive tactical devices, such as chopper support or smokescreens. The constant calling of support items adds an unpredictable flair to each match, but the moment-to-moment gunplay simply isn\u2019t on the same level of the campaign. That brief moment of tremendous satisfaction when you score a headshot flat-out does not exist online. The lower lethality of weapons on the adversarial side contradicts the \u201cauthenticity\u201d EA and Danger Close have been so vocal about \u2013 lethal shots to your foes\u2019 heads and hearts often don\u2019t drop them dead, utterly ruining the pace of an already wounded multiplayer experience.\n\nMedal of Honor Warfighter\u2019s core design is deeply problematic, and technical issues only cut into it deeper. In both the campaign and online modes, character models vanish from existence, sound drops in and out, the frame rate tanks, and textures sometimes look washed-out and low-res on consoles, even after applying a 2GB HD update in the Xbox 360 version. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a Frostbite Engine game failing to function at a basic level, and it\u2019s a real shame.\n\nGorgeous visuals and high production values can only carry a poor experience so far. Expect to spend a lot of time waiting, watching, and wondering why you\u2019re bothering to play at all during Medal of Honor Warfighter\u2019s disappointing, confusing campaign.\n\nAt its core, Warfighter is a functional shooter built on trite design ideas, but significant technical problems knock it below the realm of mediocrity. This isn\u2019t just an upsetting sequel or me-too military shooter \u2013 Warfighter is disrespectful of your time and unwilling or unable to adapt to what\u2019s been done better elsewhere. \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

As it turns out, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask was well worth the wait. Featuring a new set of mysteries for Layton and friends to unravel, this puzzling 3DS adventure easily ranks among the most delightful offerings of the year.\n\nFalling in line with past adventures, Miracle Mask has players exploring a fictional location (this time it\u2019s the booming holiday town, Monte d\u2019Or) through the eyes of Layton, his assistant Emmy and his apprentice Luke. As the three investigate the mysterious and extravagant assaults made on the town by the Masked Gentleman, they run into an array of colorful characters - many of whom, as fate would have it, happen to have a puzzle or two they need help cracking. It\u2019s as delightful a formula now as it ever was, bolstered by brilliant localization, exceptional puzzle design and a spiffy new visual presentation that makes full use of the system\u2019s signature 3D effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy far the game\u2019s most noticeable upgrade comes via the franchise\u2019s first foray into three-dimensional graphics. 3D character models now supplement the gorgeous, hand-painted backgrounds, and buoyant animations help move along the text-box dialogue. This new approach lends even more personality to Layton\u2019s world (who knew that was even possible?) and does a bang-up job of bringing these colorful characters to life. Overall the new style is a win, and while the 3D models sometimes don\u2019t seem to fit in as well with the lovely 2D cutscenes peppered throughout the narrative, small improvements (like getting to watch the characters interact before your eyes or Layton triumphantly swinging his pointer finger toward the screen after solving a puzzle) offer more than a fair trade-off for this slight downgrade.\n\nThe puzzles themselves also benefit from this slick, new art design, with top-screen visuals - often presented in stereoscopic 3D - effectively illustrating the conundrum at hand. You\u2019ll find plenty of variety too, with well over 100 puzzles to solve over the course of the adventure, ranging from guiding a lost ladybug to sliding penguins around ice cubes to unraveling riddles and working your way through tricky logic puzzles. The forgiving difficulty progression should successfully ease novice puzzlers into the swing of things, but there are plenty of head-scratchers further down the line for those looking for more of a challenge.\n\nBefitting the king of puzzles (or the \u201cprofessor\u201d of puzzles, I suppose), the puzzle design in Miracle Mask is top notch. You\u2019ll find a plethora of clever brainteasers, all supplemented by a series of helpful hints for those who don\u2019t mind spending their hard-earned Hint Coins. Even the simpler puzzles will leave you quite satisfied upon completion, as the game\u2019s charming setting and delightful music make for an ideally relaxing environment to cozy up with a good puzzle. Layton loyalists will likely notice that the game sometimes treads familiar territory in terms of puzzle types, but there are enough new puzzle formats and unique offerings that the experience is never hindered by the repeat concepts. Paired with the slick new presentation, Miracle Mask\u2019s puzzle offerings rank among Layton\u2019s best.\n\nWhile Miracle Mask is a sequel to last year\u2019s Professor Layton and the Last Specter, it does a fine job of standing on its own, as nothing is really lost for having missed prior installments (outside of a few missed references here and there). The story itself is quite fascinating, as the intrigue surrounding the city\u2019s rise to prominence and a tragedy from Layton\u2019s past make for an engrossing (and at times moving) backdrop for the Masked Gentleman\u2019s chaos.\n\nMiracle Mask weaves together two parallel tales (one set in the present and one set in the past) magnificently, and the way each segment contributes to how the overall mystery unfolds is truly fascinating. Getting to spend some time with a young and inexperienced Layton should also prove a pure joy for fans of the series. However, the game does suffer from a slower start than Last Specter. While it isn\u2019t quite as effective as past titles at immediately wrapping you in, it doesn\u2019t take terribly long to find its stride and, once it does, it\u2019s smooth sailing straight to the end.\n\nThe professor wasn&#Array;t always interested in puzzles?! Madness, I say!\n\nWhile the puzzles and mysteries are certainly the main dish, interfacing with all the different characters and getting to know the bustling streets of Monte d\u2019Or are also key ingredients in creating that certain Layton magic you can\u2019t really get anywhere else. One downside, however, is that, in order to maintain focus on the upper screen\u2019s 3D presentation, the way you actually interact with the world has been altered from previous installments.\n\nRather than tapping around an area on the bottom screen to unearth Hint Coins and engage with people, you now slide the stylus around the bottom screen while a magnifying glass glides over the surroundings presented on the top screen. The world of Layton felt somehow more alive and tangible when you could actually reach out and touch it with your stylus, so while this new method is completely functional, it still feels like something of a downgrade. However, while using the magnifying glass is perhaps not as immediate or accurate as actually touching the world with your stylus, you get used to it remarkably quickly, and it\u2019s an effective way to highlight the game\u2019s new graphics and subtle use of 3D. That you can actually see the magnifying glass sliding in and out of the background depending on where you move it is also an impressive effect, one that almost makes up for the fact that you can no longer actively tap lampposts in your quest for Hint Coins.\n\nAs for players who fly right through the main story (which will clock in at just over a dozen hours, assuming you\u2019re not too much of a dawdler or a completionist), the game offers plenty of supplementary content to keep you occupied. Those who do a thorough job of examining every inch of their surroundings will find hundreds of hidden Hint Coins and a variety of different items for their Collection. And adding to the already robust puzzle index,\u00a0 Nintendo will be releasing a new puzzle every day for an entire year once the game launches - ensuring plenty of Layton goodness for months to come.\n\nA few mini-games also round out the package, including one where you guide a robot through a selection of obstacle-laden levels, one where you stack shelves to encourage customers to buy out your stock, and one that smacks of Nintendogs where you help a rabbit achieve its full acting potential. They\u2019re all three quite different, all inexplicably charming, and all really more fun than they should be.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s played a Layton game in the past, this is very much the same deal - and considering the professor\u2019s offerings are among portable gaming\u2019s best, that\u2019s certainly a compliment. Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask offers a gorgeous visual presentation, an intriguing story and incredible puzzle design - all in one of the most charming gaming worlds out there. The game may take somewhat longer than usual to find its stride, and sliding the stylus simply isn\u2019t as fulfilling as tapping it when it comes to world exploration, but the game\u2019s accomplishments far outweigh these trifling complaints. Puzzle lovers young and old should make it a point to unravel the mysteries of the Miracle Mask.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say to his henchmen. All who hear him probably think it\u2019s good advice, wisdom dispensed to survive an impending attack by you, a relentless killer. So they follow orders and do what they\u2019ve been trained to do. Some stand with guns, some patrol rooms with knives, and all are ready to slash and shoot and murder the intruder in a bloody font of insta-death. Yet none who heard the order appreciate its irony. They don\u2019t comprehend that by following protocol they follow the game rules that you've learned to overcome, and that by complying with their boss set themselves up to have their brains splattered against the wall and organs spilled across the floor.\n\nDennaton Games\u2019 Hotline Miami is stuffed with moments like this that stir up identity and purpose into a neon-lashed, ultraviolent, self-aware skewering of video game conventions and the nature of entertainment.

They are initially framed as non-essential. The only way to truly interact with the world is to kill. Such is the case with many games, yet few call out the inanity of it so bluntly.\n\nBefore a mission begins you put on a mask. Each confers gameplay bonuses and further obfuscates your identity to place emphasis on what you do, not who you are. The overhead perspective serves a similar dual purpose. It enables you to look across vast stretches of each playable area where enemies wait behind doors and breakable windows to kill you in a fraction of a second. The perspective allows\u00a0 you to plan how to move, from which angle to fire a shotgun or toss a knife or stun an enemy by opening a door behind him just as he passes then proceed to wreck his face against the floor. The perspective also dehumanizes your targets by presenting them as only heads and shoulders and weapons, an effect strengthened by their pixelated appearance. It\u2019s not until they\u2019re dead and their bodies sprawl across the ground in full view with blood pooling about them that they feel human and, maybe for a moment, you feel a twitch of remorse.\n\nYet whatever regret you may have over brutally and relentlessly murdering is immediately neutered as Hotline Miami flashes a giant score bonus over each fresh corpse. Kill multiple people quickly and you\u2019ll build combos. With enough speed and efficiency and recklessness you\u2019ll amass higher scores and unlock more masks and weapons and receive better ratings at each mission\u2019s end. The gameplay is kind of stealth but mostly quick action. You wait around hallway corners for an enemy to walk away then sprint around the corner with a crowbar, break his head, toss the crowbar at the shotgun-carrying enemy in the room\u2019s corner to score a stun, throat rip the guy who just wandered in then pounce on the still-stunned foe to punctuate the spree with a burst of gore, and in those moments of blood-soaked success feel a rush of satisfaction because it could have gone so horribly wrong.\n\nDennaton uses story and gameplay to twist identity.\n\nHotline Miami doesn\u2019t only share the same audio-visual themes of Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Drive (the director is specifically thanked in the credits), but also the same kind of startling ease of transition between life and death. In general, if you get hit, you die, and if you hit an enemy, they die. The game auto-saves after you change floors of the buildings you assault, but each floor needs to be cleared without making a mistake. Resetting is quick and encouraged, much in the same way as Trials HD or Super Hexagon. Mess up and you can instantly return to the action armed with more knowledge of enemy positions and map layout. Even after you learn everything about a stage, when you respawn enemies may move in a slightly different way and they may not carry the same weapons, so memorization alone won\u2019t result in success. There\u2019s always an element of chaos in the action that parallels the puzzling tendrils of the story. Stringing together a continuous combo throughout a stage often requires frantic improvisation and prevents the action from suffering from too much predictability.\n\nMore depth is added through the way Dennaton handles sound. Bats and crowbars are quiet, but guns draw attention. You could run into a room and try to cut everything apart with a shotgun, but in a populated stage it\u2019ll bring in others, some of whom may flatten you before they\u2019re even visible with an unavoidable burst of bullets. To get around this you can target an enemy before entering a room, you can silently fling your weapon to temporarily knock him out, which may give you enough time to punch a patrolling enemy, steal his weapon and murder them both without alerting anyone else. Getting better at effectively juggling these variables, managing sound and line of sight and speed, is a rapid, noticeable process, and the sense of reward for efficiently cutting down all lethal threats is significant because there\u2019s room to slay with custom style.\n\nViolence is rewarded while purpose is clouded.\n\nAs the body count rises, the sense of disconnection with the tragedy of what\u2019s happening onscreen grows. You crave more kills to again feel that rush of just barely surviving and seeing those big, flashy numbers burst across the screen with Peggle-like splendor. You begin to think more and more like the serial killer you\u2019re playing and find delight in the purity of the task, not the implications. Yet for all the ways Hotline Miami seems to needlessly pop skulls and spray blood, it does so for a reason.\n\nIt\u2019s hinted throughout the early non-combat scenes that bookend missions that at first seem so disposable.

Even as the world around you is corrupted by the grotesque and shop owners carry on disturbingly reasonable conversations with corpses bleeding at their feet, you don\u2019t react. You proceed as usual, mission to mission, a process suggestive of a far deeper and troubling psychosis, again thickening the layers of dishonesty in Hotline Miami\u2019s presentation and strengthening its motivating sense of intrigue.

It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say to his henchmen.

Such appeals to a player\u2019s humanity are bold but risky moves in a military shooter, where countless corpses of faceless terrorists pile up at your feet.\n\nWarfighter strives for this by giving you a genuine impression of what it\u2019s like to live as a Tier 1 operator, the elite operatives at the center of the modernized Medal of Honor series. It\u2019s clear from the first cutscene all the way to the end credits that developer Danger Close has the utmost respect for the extraordinary skills and bravery of these soldiers. If Medal of Honor extended the same level of respect to its players, Warfighter might have accomplished more than its numerous significant failures and lack of player agency has allowed.\n\nThis scene is so scripted you can finish it without touching a button.\n\nThe landscape of the first-person shooter is not the same as it once was. The 2010 series reboot was a competent mimicry of what had worked previously, and its sequel continues to ignore innovation. For the entirety of its brief five-hour campaign, Warfighter spotlights one tired design idea after the other. Each linear action sequence boils down to whack-a-mole with firearms: AI enemies mindlessly pop out from the same cover spots or stand out in the open just waiting to die. When they\u2019ve all been killed, your squad kicks down a door, kills a handful of evil terrorists in slow motion, and moves onto the next section of the predictable pattern. Warfighter leaves little room for strategic thinking, too, since it funnels your team down narrow paths by blocking alternative routes with rocks, bushes, or invisible walls.\n\n poilib start \n\nAn entire two-minute mission consists of taking a single shot you can\u2019t miss.\n\n poilib end  Much of Medal of Honor is out of your hands, stripping you of the satisfaction that comes with making a difference or any impact on the world in a meaningful way. Many doors don\u2019t open until allies let you through. Suspects you chase on foot conveniently wait when you fall behind. Choppers fly in to finish the job you couldn\u2019t, airstrikes level buildings in your way, and an entire two-minute mission consists of taking a single shot you can\u2019t miss. Hey, at least the weapons feel terrific, with bullets biting through enemies at an almost uncomfortable level of efficiency. Great firefights are par for the course in Frostbite Engine-powered games, and Medal of Honor feels as good as it looks. Warfighter\u2019s incredible attention to atmospheric environmental detail gives Battlefield 3 a run for its money, and establishes a sense of place where the level design can't.\n\nThe bare-bones mission design of Warfighter is entirely in service of its mantra, not its players. That is, Medal of Honor\u2019s campaign wants to throw you into situations \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s devastating to whatever story Warfighter fails to tell. The primary objective is buried by disjointed jumps from one character or country to the next \u2013 as it has been in Battlefield and Call of Duty as well. It\u2019s hard to keep the dots connected, too, because the timeline follows no discernible order and features flashbacks within flashbacks. The narrative of Warfighter\u2019s core revolves around the dissolution and rebuilding of an operator\u2019s family, but the characters and in-game events compromise pathos. How can anyone empathize with a broken man who spends the next few hours plunging a hatchet into hearts, snapping necks, and generally slaughtering hundreds of other people?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a massive disconnect between the story Danger Close wants to to tell and the game it\u2019s made, and both suffer because of each other. All of this leaves Warfighter as uninteresting as it is disengaged, and none of its promises pay off. This is equally true in the hollow multiplayer. Abysmal map design cripples the already uninspired objective-based modes, creating obstacles cutting off paths to a bomb site or a flag return point. Shrubbery and impassable rubble obscure routes, creating a dense clutter even in the biggest maps, while spawn camping is an intensely frustrating problem in nearly all modes.\n\n poilib start \n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen a Frostbite Engine game failing to function at a basic level.\n\n poilib end  A few variables on existing formulas make those multiplayer game types different from its contemporaries, but not in a substantial enough way to stand out above them. Hotspot constantly changes bomb-planting locations and Home Run forbids respawns during Capture the Flag \u2013 interesting twists, but other shooters, including Medal of Honor\u2019s sister series, Battlefield, have explored similar conventions better.\n\nLess exciting than it looks.\n\nEven Warfighter\u2019s class system is outdone by better multiplayer games. Each specialty has its own unique skills, such as the heavy\u2019s armor boost or the scout\u2019s ability to see through walls, but the customization of those characters is limited to their weapons. Streak bonuses unlock as you score points, giving you the choice between aggressive/defensive tactical devices, such as chopper support or smokescreens. The constant calling of support items adds an unpredictable flair to each match, but the moment-to-moment gunplay simply isn\u2019t on the same level of the campaign. That brief moment of tremendous satisfaction when you score a headshot flat-out does not exist online. The lower lethality of weapons on the adversarial side contradicts the \u201cauthenticity\u201d EA and Danger Close have been so vocal about \u2013 lethal shots to your foes\u2019 heads and hearts often don\u2019t drop them dead, utterly ruining the pace of an already wounded multiplayer experience.\n\nMedal of Honor Warfighter\u2019s core design is deeply problematic, and technical issues only cut into it deeper. In both the campaign and online modes, character models vanish from existence, sound drops in and out, the frame rate tanks, and textures sometimes look washed-out and low-res on consoles, even after applying a 2GB HD update in the Xbox 360 version.

{"game": "Transformers: Fall of Cybertron", "index": 63, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/transformers-fall-of-cybertron/xbox-360-92426", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/21/transformers-fall-of-cybertron-review", "review": "Following years of mediocre, movie-tied titles, 2010's Transformers: War for Cybertron finally did right by the Robots in Disguise. The series lost some ground\u2014and geek cred\u2014with last year's film-based Dark of the Moon, but with no Michael Bay influence in sight, the franchise has returned with a proper follow-up to what's widely considered the best game the toy license has ever seen. Rather than taking the quick-cash path and simply duplicating War's successful formula, though, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron retains its predecessor's core appeal while tweaking its template in some significant ways. The result is another solid entry that improves upon the game that spawned it, but also takes a small robot step backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of presentation, storytelling, and production values, Fall of Cybertron trumps its older brother across the board. While it takes place on the battling bots' same war-ravaged home planet, its visuals feature far more detail and variety. Over the course of the campaign's 13 chapters, players are treated to sprawling, scarred battlefields, cloud-sitting cityscapes, creepy interior dwellings, ancient sand-choked ruins, and slime-covered subterranean settings.

Where War allowed players to pick a character before entering each level, Fall sets them up with a specific Autobot or Decepticon at the start of every chapter; this might sound limiting, but it's allowed the developers to carefully craft each chapter around a specific hero\u2019s abilities. So rather than simply barreling through each level from behind any old bot with a big-ass gun, players find themselves relying on Cliffjumper's cloaking ability to navigate a level built around stealth, bouncing around a virtual jungle gym with Jazz's grappling hook, and unleashing all kinds of hell in arena-style areas as Grimlock.\n\nSpeaking of the gravelly voiced Dinobot, fans will be happy to know he makes far more than just a cameo. Grimlock, with his sword-and-shield-wielding form as well as his fire-spitting Jurassic state, is playable for a good 60-90 minutes of the campaign. The other new characters possess their fair share of fan-pleasing moments, too. It's fun to unleash Metroplex, Optimus' personal, remote-controlled Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robot, and harnessing your inner Godzilla behind the screen-clearing Bruticus is an absolute blast.\n\nNo co-op?

Additionally, the inclusion of those aforementioned cameo characters not only introduce creative new ways to crush robots like beer cans, but also support key plot points; Grimlock, for example, has garnered plenty of buzz for his over-the-top attacks, but his integral role in the overarching narrative actually outshines his ability to barbeque bad guys with his breath. Many objectives are also buoyed by a fantastic sense of urgency; whether frantically outrunning rising toxic waste as Jazz or attempting to halt a getaway transport as Swindle, there are more than a few time-based tasks capable of causing heart palpitations. Additionally, a few point-defending scenarios along the campaign path could teach any Horde-like mode a thing or two about getting players' trigger fingers and pulses pounding in unison.\n\nRegrettably, War's popular campaign co-op has been cut for Fall.

The series lost some ground\u2014and geek cred\u2014with last year's film-based Dark of the Moon, but with no Michael Bay influence in sight, the franchise has returned with a proper follow-up to what's widely considered the best game the toy license has ever seen. Rather than taking the quick-cash path and simply duplicating War's successful formula, though, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron retains its predecessor's core appeal while tweaking its template in some significant ways. The result is another solid entry that improves upon the game that spawned it, but also takes a small robot step backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of presentation, storytelling, and production values, Fall of Cybertron trumps its older brother across the board. While it takes place on the battling bots' same war-ravaged home planet, its visuals feature far more detail and variety. Over the course of the campaign's 13 chapters, players are treated to sprawling, scarred battlefields, cloud-sitting cityscapes, creepy interior dwellings, ancient sand-choked ruins, and slime-covered subterranean settings.

{"game": "Hero Academy", "index": 65, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/hero-academy-136971/pc-122908", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/20/hero-academy-review", "review": "After spending the better part of a week slaying orcs, humans, and other heroes, I finally understand why all my friends were raving earlier this year when Hero Academy launched for iOS. It\u2019s fantastic. Underneath the deceptively cute art style lies a surprisingly deep strategy game that takes hours to really even begin to master. Far from being a casual game, Hero Academy plays more like chess, where great minds that think ahead and understand both their own capabilities and that of their enemies will come out ahead. Asynchronous and cross-platform multiplayer cinches the whole package, making Hero Academy far too easy to play for hours on end, whether at home or on the go.\n\nHero Academy lets two player-controlled teams battle it out on a game board in turn-based combat. After selecting which team you want to play (currently there are Orcs, Humans, Dark Elves, Dwarves and the Team Fortress 2 soldiers), you then deploy them onto a random level. You can only take five actions per turn for your entire team, so you have to put your smarts to use and figure out the best way to either destroy the enemy team or kill their crystals.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from any action-points driven strategy game, how you spend your points means everything. Other turn-based strategy games typically assign different actions varying point values, but in Hero Academy every move costs one point. Whether you\u2019re using this point to drop a new soldier onto the battlefield, attack an enemy, give one of your own heroes a buff, or simply move to a different tile, you always use one point. It keeps things approachable for people less familiar with turn-based games, and also makes it easier to rapidly knock out turns. You can also start to predict what the enemy team will do a bit better, since you know exactly how many moves he can make.\n\nEase-of-use really is a mantra throughout the design of Hero Academy, and whether you\u2019re new to turn-based games or seasoned you\u2019ll appreciate its smart rewind feature. After taking all your actions you can simply click your action points wheel and rewind to the start of your turn (or even regress move-by-move if you wish). This means you can try out your strategy and see how well -- or poorly -- it\u2019ll do, adjusting accordingly. It encourages a lot of experimentation because there\u2019s no risk -- only reward. It\u2019s an utterly brilliant feature, and does away with a lot of the pain many new players would otherwise feel as they simply learn by getting stomped on by skilled opponents.\n\nIt\u2019s really good that Hero Academy encourages you to experiment, because gameplay gets much deeper than you might first expect. Sure, it sounds simple: take five actions in a turn, kill the other side or their crystal. But each team of heroes plays differently from the next; they\u2019re not symmetrical. Every team has some basic archetypes like healers, warriors and ranged damage dealers, but they each have special rules that set them apart. Units don\u2019t all have the same movement values either, so, like chess, it\u2019s important to understand not only your own forces but those you\u2019re up against. Add to this the special abilities of each army and that every game board has special buff-giving tiles, and every action becomes a hard-to-make choice. You don\u2019t even have access to the entirety of your army every turn, but are instead randomly dealt units and powers from a virtual deck of sorts, making you further adapt your strategy based on what\u2019s available to you on a given turn. You could take what's there, or, if you're unhappy, swap some out at the cost of action points. Quite simply, it\u2019d be overwhelming if you couldn\u2019t try things out noncommittally because there are always so many choices available.\n\nIf that all sounds a bit too intense, don\u2019t fret -- Hero Academy has a lot of resources available to teach new players. You can start with the in-game tutorial levels and then move onto the in-game guide. If that\u2019s still not enough, or if you\u2019re just looking for a change of pace, you can play Challenge levels for each team you own. The Challenge levels aren\u2019t only great little tweaks on the gameplay that feel similar to a puzzle game but they also teach you the intricacies and capabilities of individual units by letting you see them in action.\n\nImage is from the PC version.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got access to both a PC and an iOS device, then there\u2019s always a reason to have a game of Hero Academy going as it supports cross-platform functionality. The games are pretty much identical between the two platforms, with the one substantial difference being that iOS players get the human team for free, while the only way to access the game on PC is to buy it for $4.99. Still, that\u2019s not a bad price, especially considering that this also nets you both the human and Team Fortress 2 teams, which you can then use on the go. It\u2019d be nice if the PC version supported different resolutions, but the nice part about it being so minimalistic is that it can quietly run in the background without being a resource hog. It even gives you notifications when someone else takes their turns, enticing you to return. Devilish and effective.\n\nBecause Hero Academy is asynchronous you\u2019re encouraged to have a large number of games going at any time. Quickly knock out all your turns, start up a few new games, and then return later when you\u2019re friends or random opponents have taken their actions. If they still haven\u2019t, you can quickly start up some new games. There\u2019s basically never a reason to not be playing against someone, and you\u2019re never pressured to take a turn. You do things at your own pace.\n\nEven if you buy all the teams Hero Academy will barely cost you $15. For that price you get a strategy game you can play indefinitely, and whose tactical elements are deep enough to entrance everyone from the casual gamer to the strategy enthusiast. With the ability to play on-the-go or at home, Hero Academy is not only a fantastic option for mobile gamers but anyone looking for a new strategy game to sink their teeth into. \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Beneath that strange energy field, dubbed the Anomaly, something stirs in the wake of an alien ship crash. Unverified reports say the invaders have set up defenses surrounding the wreckage, but unconfirmed theories don't cut it anymore. A team must be sent into the dome to investigate and see just who has taken up residence on the former site of Babylon. You are going to lead that team. \n\n However, Anomaly is not an ass-kicking, kill-'em-all alien shooter. Instead, it's a smart riff on the tower defense formula. Instead of setting up lines of defenses for incoming crawlers, you are the forces that must survive the gauntlet. The aliens have many different weapons with myriad strengths and weakness, so survival depends on your ability to outflank (and out-think) these extra-terrestrial cutthroats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You control a small on-foot commander that scouts out positions, picks up essential power-ups, and deploys resources as needed. You must make sure your column of vehicles (which you do not directly control) makes it through the defenses. You choose the make-up of your convoy \u2013 APCs, launchers, shielding vehicles, etc. \u2013 as well as the order of the vehicles within the column. Leading with a well-armored APC, for example, will take some heat off the devastating but poorly armored launchers. \n\n Though you can create and upgrade a beefy convoy, success typically boils down to two things: your power-up deployment and your route planning. While you do not drive or aim vehicle weapons, you can zoom out to a high-level map view and click on intersections to designate the column's route through the battlezone. Strangely, I had a lot of fun just trying to make the most efficient routes that could cause the greatest amount of devastation while minimizing both exposure and travel time. \n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end   Supporting your column with power-ups is where Anomaly gets frenzied. If you think tower defense games are too chill, Anomaly's script-flip will have you rethinking that position. You have vehicle repair stations, smoke screens, decoys, and more at your disposal \u2013 all with timers and different areas of effect. The wide smoke screen will obscure your column for multiple enemy towers, but it doesn't last very long. Dropping a decoy in the middle of a firefight is great for drawing fire away from your vehicles, either giving them breathing room for fighting back or a break in the action for rumbling through a repair power-up. \n\n I became downright excitable during some intense firefights, especially when I realized too late that my route was decidedly less than optimal. I rushed around the streets, trying to replenish spent power-ups by picking up air drops while remaining close enough to my column to give it the support it needed. The commander can be temporarily incapacitated from alien blasts, too, which can prove disastrous if it happens at the same moment the column is most vulnerable. The balance of strategy and action is really impressive. While there are down times as you roll through a cleared area, when the lasers start raining down from the towers and I realized my column was in trouble, I was as wide-eyed hunched over Anomaly as I've been in some games of Team Fortress 2. \n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end   Anomaly benefits from great settings, especially the Baghdad location, which tells a narrative without ever speaking a line of dialog. That's good because the actual dialog in Anomaly is rather cut-and-paste tough guy soldier tropes. However, regardless of the script, Anomaly does tell a solid story with a good mid-game wrinkle that sends this alien invasion story spinning into another direction. \n\n Developer 11 bit's art direction in Anomaly is striking, too. The war zones are appropriately battered, but the use of bright colors (reds, blues, and greens really pop off the screen) make sure Anomaly doesn't settle into a monotonous sea of desert browns or cityscape grays. The alien designs are playful, although when I was being slammed by an 80-foot-tall behemoth, I found the invaders to be anything but.  \n\nAnomaly: Warzone Earth is a clever twist on tower defense that will rope back in gamers that think they&#Array;ve had enough of the well-worn formula. The balancing act between action and strategy is nicely tuned. Even when the firefights are ferocious, you&#Array;re still thinking about adjusting routes and how to smartly deploy precious power-ups so you don&#Array;t run dry later in the mission. And to top it all off, Anomaly&#Array;s good story and great locations give you constant reasons to fight. You always want to see what happens next. Thankfully, the gameplay itself is strong enough to bring you back even after the final act.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing - an amalgamation of such incredible franchises could have resulted in the game to end all games. The thing is, if you\u2019re going to so blatantly derive material from such well-known properties, you better nail it. While Darksiders II provides a lengthy and entertaining experience for action adventure fans to sink their teeth into, in the end it never comes close to reaching the heights of the various franchises it so freely borrows from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarksiders II further fleshes out the story of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse introduced in the first title - this time with War\u2019s brother, Death, at the helm. Death believes that War has been wrongfully convicted of destroying mankind, and seeks to restore humanity to clear his brother\u2019s name. The narrative is pretty entertaining, if not severely overdramatic. Though it should please anyone solely in the market for \u2018epic,\u2019 it lacks any trace of subtlety and often comes off as sophomoric. Given that the end result of any plot advancement is inevitably that Death needs to gather three of something and thrash some skeletons, hearing the characters go on about the old ways and soul judgement just feels a bit silly. However, if a healthy dose of ridiculous doesn\u2019t faze you, the contrived reasons for Death\u2019s various escapades through heaven, hell and everywhere in between do provide an amusing backdrop for his quest.\n\nThe majority of the adventure comprises rather standard action fare - Death wields both a fast primary weapon and a slow but powerful secondary weapon, and you chain together moves to slash your way through the various enemies.\u00a0 There are also a few special abilities you gain along the way - like the ability to summon demon lords to do your bidding or to split your soul in two to solve dungeon puzzles. The action segments are enjoyable enough - inasmuch as it\u2019s hard to make slicing up undead baddies unenjoyable. Still, it\u2019s disappointing that most of the enemies require next to no strategy to overcome. When you do come across an enemy that requires strategy to best, the joy of slaying it is truly satisfying - but these occurrences are few and far between. Most of the time, the answer is just to wait for the enemy to make their move, dodge, then attack. It\u2019s still fun, because dodging and attacking are fun things to do in an action game, but it does get irritatingly repetitive after several hours of the same old song and dance.\n\nOne of the touted selling points of Darksiders II is that it\u2019s far bigger than its predecessor - with a map that\u2019s more than twice as big and a campaign that\u2019s about three times longer than the original adventure. Unfortunately, in this case, bigger definitely isn\u2019t better. The freedom Darksiders II offers is something to behold - you\u2019re able to journey around huge areas as you please, slashing enemies and seeking out treasure and loot drops to your heart\u2019s content. But the bloated environments are simply too barren and often devoid of anything interesting to do or see. Since so little is done to vary up the gameplay, the pacing drags and the length of the adventure feels more like a chore than a bonus.\n\nThe main problem is that the bulk of the adventure is repetitive. While it\u2019s completely possible to reuse game mechanics throughout a campaign and still keep it feeling fresh,\u00a0Darksiders II doesn\u2019t achieve this. You\u2019ll find yourself climbing wooden ledges and pegs, setting off bombs, and rolling balls\u00a0over and over again in exactly same way, instilling a gnawing sense of deja vu. If these mechanics were employed in varied and clever ways, that would be one thing - but they\u2019re not. I found myself rarely challenged by any puzzle I came across, and was often astonished that I was once again expected to repeat the same menial task I had just completed in the previous dungeon, or even in the previous room.\n\nThis is no place for a horse.\n\nOn the bright side, Darksiders II does offer up some truly epic boss fights to vary up the repetition, ones that will put your skills to the test and are truly exciting to overcome. You\u2019ll fight all kinds of epic demons - ones that can regenerate, ones that are about 100 times your size, and ones that are just plain brutal in their assault patterns. The bosses are one of the highlights of the experience, offering a glimpse of what Darksiders II could have been had the entire quest been as varied and balanced as these memorable battles.\u00a0\n\nAs for gamers who don\u2019t like fetch quests - this game is not for you. Seriously, the entire game is a fetch quest. All you do is run from area to area, fetching three of these, then three of these, then two of these, then three more of these with combat in between. As someone who honestly doesn\u2019t mind a healthy dose of fetching in her games, Darksiders II still pushed my limits. You end up fetching so much and for so long that the majority of the game feels pretty pointless by the end. Can\u2019t anyone in these various realms do their own errands, for crying out loud?\n\nIn truth, the game would have benefitted from being a skosh smaller and a lot more focused. In this way, the original game beats its sequel, as a more linear adventure that keeps the action coming befits this franchise\u2019s intense style of gameplay. After all, there is a limit to how long you can run through similar environments and solve similar puzzles in order to appease your bloodlust for smashing things with cool weapons.\n\nOne of the game\u2019s stronger elements is its art design and voice direction. It\u2019s incredible that you can grow so fond of a main character who literally never emotes, as he\u2019s wearing a skull mask for the entirety of the adventure. Death\u2019s awesome voicework doesn't hurt either - hearing him growl at the Makers or deliver lines like, \u201cThis is no place for a Horse,\u201d or \u201cYou find something for a change,\u201d is inexplicably enjoyable. Even though he\u2019s pretty impossible to relate to - being the embodiment of death and all - his design and presentation still do a great job of making him someone you want to see to his journey\u2019s end.\n\nWhile too many of the environments in Darksiders II are shockingly similar, some of them are well thought out and epic to behold, as are many of the characters and enemies found within. Unfortunately, the graphics aren\u2019t quite up to snuff with the current generation of hardware. Some of the textures are so pixilated they look like they belong on a Wii, such as the oft-used skull and bones pattern (which is alarmingly flat, and thereby entirely unconvincing). It\u2019s a shame, as the mediocre graphics undermine the game\u2019s inspired art design. The animations are also quite choppy, as the game suffers from some fairly frequent framerate issues. There\u2019s rarely enough happening onscreen to justify these MMO-like graphics. It looks good enough that it usually won\u2019t distract from the adventure, but compared to similar games like God of War 3, the graphical presentation of Darksiders II is subpar.\n\n\n\nA frustrating detractor to Darksiders II is the sheer amount of random glitches you\u2019ll encounter along the way - ones that can\u2019t be accounted for and appear and disappear for seemingly no reason at all. Seeing Death floating above the ground or over thin air is not uncommon, nor is pressing B to perform an action command only for nothing to happen until a few button presses later. Other random glitches I encountered include the inability to discard boots, ally AI that just stands in the corner staring at the wall, a Primary Quest icon that leads you in the wrong direction (then shift positions when you check the in-menu map), and an absence of music and sound effects until the game was reset - and that\u2019s just to name a few. Most of these glitches only last for a short while, then disappear never to surface again. Others, like a targeting system that rarely seems to target the closest enemy or a camera that is often pointing in an inopportune direction, are quite persistent. Sadly, they\u2019re things you\u2019ll just have to learn to cope with if you hope to see Death\u2019s journey to its conclusion.\u00a0\n\nThe funny thing is, despite its lengthy list of flaws and failures, Darksiders II still manages to offer an enjoyable experience. Despite its lack of variety, the combat is still satisfying to engage in, especially when you run across a behemoth of a boss. And even though there\u2019s not enough to do in them, running around such huge environments is still incredible. Certain abilities you amass along the way - like the Deathgrip or the summoning ability - are terribly fun to play with, and make for some really cool dungeon moments (like dashing across a wall and Deathgripping at the last moment to reach the other side). It\u2019s also worth noting that the game picks up considerably towards the end, finally finding its stride for the last few dungeons. The puzzles get more creative, the enemies and environments more varied - it\u2019s just a shame it takes about 30 or so hours to get to this point.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nA\u00a0complete Darksiders II video walkthrough can be found in the Darksiders II Wiki -- right up to the final boss!\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nPossibly the best part of the adventure, something that all action RPG games could learn from, is its implementation of RPG elements such as equipment and customization. Weapons found on the field can be instantly equipped or sent to your inventory with a single button press. Furthermore, each piece of equipment\u2019s stats are displayed when you walk near it, as well as how it will raise or lower your own stats should you equip it. This makes fast decision making a breeze, and greatly increases the joy of seeking out the best armor to equip Death with. Every weapon or bit of armor you equip also changes Death\u2019s appearance, which is a cool touch in making character customization feel more personal. The concept of cursed artillery, which you can \u2018feed\u2019 other items to, is also a great way to make the underpowered loot you come across feel like less of a waste. The way equipment is handled in Darksiders II is a true revolution in RPG gameplay, and one of the most solid parts of the experience.\n\nTapping the left stick for Death\u2019s bird, Dust, to show you the general direction you should go, and the deeply engrained Fast Travel system (which lets you instantly warp back to certain areas on the fly) are also great innovations for the genre. It\u2019s a true shame the game\u2019s impressive contributions are so severely undermined by its sheer amount of flaws and glitches.\n\nDespite its problems, I was compelled onward in my quest with Death because Darksiders II is simply a fun game. The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It\u2019s a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for. Still, if you love action adventure games, it\u2019s certainly worth checking out - but don\u2019t expect it to rival the masterpieces it will inevitably call to mind.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

In the world of Puzzle Craft they\u2019re put to good use: becoming the resources you use to build and grow a town from a small village into a bustling city.\n\nPlayers begin in the farming minigame, drawing lines to connect and eliminate as many chickens, pigs, carrots and other foods as possible.\u00a0 This food is then spent to take a spin in the mines,. The resource-matching puzzle minigame plays out in the same way, but with players collecting stone, iron and other critical building materials.\n\n poilib end \n\nIt\u2019s satisfying to finally collect enough stone or silver to finally upgrade city hall or build that granary you\u2019ve had your eye on.\u00a0 But Puzzle Craft\u2019s true brilliance is that each new building and upgrade has a practical impact as well. Building the Ratcatcher\u2019s Hut reduces the frequency that the dastardly carrot-eaters & combo-breakers appear in the farming puzzle. The pig sty increases the amount of valuable pigs that show up, making them easier to collect. You\u2019re always one step away from another big upgrade.\n\nThe puzzle minigame itself might be simple, but Puzzle Craft\u2019s upgrade system hides a lot of depth that's a joy to uncover. Players must always make strategic decisions on whether their limited resources should be spent on a new building, hiring a new worker or on a single-use power-up. Making the right decisions can pay off in a big way. For example, the piles of wood you collect are near-useless. But that wood can be turned into grass-eliminating rakes, leading to huge boosts in your farming minigame score. Smart play pays off!\n\nThe town building and puzzling combine to create a fiendishly addictive gameplay loop that's almost impossible to put down. Once I constructed my Diamond Cutter's shop I might normally shut down a game, satisfied at reaching a cool milestone. But in Puzzle Craft I just want to hop in for another round to take advantage of my new diamond-grabbing abilities.\n\n poilib end \n\nSome users will be put off by Puzzle Craft\u2019s light Zynga-esque social game elements. Jumping into the farming minigame costs coins, and players only earn coins by checking in on the game every few hours or by buying more with real-world cash. Other bonuses also accumulate in realtime, to encourage gamers to come back on a daily rhythm. These bonuses don't feel hollow, like they might in a game like Farmville. I savor every chance I get to see bonus tools and items pop out of my town's buildings, since they're going to be put to use improving my next round's score.\n\nAfter my initial $0.99 purchase I never once felt pressured to put another cent into the game. Your money accumulates very quickly, and the other bonuses you receive every 4-8 hours feel like true bonuses, rather than tools and items that are essential to progress. I\u2019ve played more than 100 fun-filled rounds of Puzzle Craft (the game tells me I\u2019ve traced 717 real-world meters with my finger) for that initial $0.99 purchase price.\n\nPuzzle Craft is the most addictive puzzle mash-up to hit the App Store this year. Spending collected puzzle blocks to build a town is smart. But allowing that bustling town to power-up the puzzle minigame is brilliant. Be warned: Puzzle Craft might just take over your life. Don't miss it.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Playground Games' job was to take the incredible resources of the Forza franchise and create an open-world spin-off of this generation's leading circuit racer.\n\nThe results speak for themselves.

The road types are just as varied, ranging from narrow dirt tracks to a lengthy freeway that, in the right car, you can breach the 400 km/h mark on. It's not as large as Test Drive Unlimited's Oahu but it's significantly better looking.\n\nIn fact, most everything about Forza Horizon looks improbably good. The fingers of sunlight reaching out towards you at dusk. The scattered leaf litter and gravel being kicked up in the wake of speeding vehicles. The bustle of the Horizon Festival itself and the way the shadows of the always-rotating amusement rides dance across your dashboard. It\u2019s a world brimming with detail everywhere you look, from the leafy country lanes to the ribbons of asphalt lining dusty red canyons. It\u2019s devastatingly gorgeous. It\u2019s like Emma Stone playing bass guitar in her underpants.\n\nIt looks just as fantastic at night, too, which comes around every half hour or so. It\u2019s especially cool to note the distant soft glow of the Horizon Festival, fireworks bursting overhead, as you approach under darkness from afar.\n\nThe cars are equally impressive. The high bar set by Forza Motorsport 4 has been maintained and, in some ways, surpassed. With a full day/night cycle now in effect Forza Horizon\u2019s cars feature illuminated, working dials in cabin view. Pop up and hideaway headlamps are fully animated too, like those featured on, say, a BMW M1 or a \u201969 Charger. As the sun sets your headlights will automatically emerge from the hood or from behind the retracting grille.\n\nThe menus and overlays have a distinctly Codemasters feel to them but they\u2019re a little more subdued. This means that while the presentation feels dynamic and modern it doesn\u2019t cross the line into obnoxious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe audio design also rates a positive mention. Like Forza 4 the engine notes of the game's various steeds remain uniformly excellent. Open the taps in a tunnel and know that somewhere, somehow Jeremy Clarkson is grinning uncontrollably. It sounds like Zeus trying to swallow a hammer drill. The radio is probably mixed a little too loud, but you can easily adjust it. Knocking the radio down to an audio level of 14 (from 20) and leaving the car volume maxed seemed to do the trick.\n\nThe radio itself isn\u2019t too bad, to be honest. The mix of music and DJ chatter seems pretty organic, although you\u2019ll definitely grow tired of the tracklist before you get anywhere near finishing up everything the game has to offer.\n\nMore important than the audio visual side of the equation, though, is obviously the nature of the racing itself. The Forza teams on both sides of the Atlantic have spoken at length about Forza DNA in the lead up to the release of Forza Horizon. It\u2019s the feel of the game, the thing the Forza 4 faithful were sure was going to be compromised in this open world spin-off. I could tell you that the physics under the hood of Forza Horizon, the ones that infuse every car with its own unique handling characteristics, have been migrated directly from its track-based stable mate \u2013 but that would be just taking Playground\u2019s word for it. What I will tell you is that if you\u2019re fresh from Forza 4 you won\u2019t miss a beat sliding behind the wheel in Forza Horizon. It\u2019s impossible to confuse these games as anything but relatives. They\u2019re like Baldwin brothers. Adjust the driving assists to your usual preferences and you\u2019ll find the Forza feel \u2013 this Forza DNA \u2013 remains intact.\n\nAs a side note, I had a great little shared DNA metaphor, where Forza 4 was the faithful family dog, dependable, well-behaved and happy to be contained in a walled-yard and Forza Horizon was something else. Like a coyote or something. An animal that says bollocks to fences and runs around causing mayhem all over the countryside. Then I heard humans share about 50 per cent of our DNA with bananas and it suddenly didn\u2019t seem all that clever. The important thing is that these games feel like they have a shared ancestor.\n\nDrive it like you stole it.\n\nThe handling is entirely satisfying, whether you\u2019re drifting around a gravel corner on the game\u2019s new offroad surfaces or weaving through freeway traffic with your foot on the firewall. If you prefer your racing games a little more straightforward and manageable, Forza Horizon will suit you fine with its full suite of driving assists. However, this game is definitely at its best with simulation steering on and traction control off because that\u2019s when it\u2019s at its most unpredictable. It becomes more than just mashing the throttle and pointing your car in the direction you want to go at this point; it demands finesse.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll be doing is racing, and a lot of it. You work through the Horizon Festival competitors tiers by completing festival races. These could be point-to-point races across the game\u2019s varied terrain, circuit races on closed-off street courses, or even mixed surface races featuring both asphalt and gravel or dirt. Horizon outposts, which are hubs scattered around the map you can teleport to, contain special PR stunts. There are three types of PR stunts. Speed challenges require you to hit a speed trap at a minimum rate of knots to pass. Photo challenges see you nursing a special vehicle to a certain picturesque point on the map and snapping an image. Stunt challenges set a score target for you to hit by chaining together drifts, near misses and other dangerous driving. There are also Showcase events, rationed out to you as you work your way through the game, that pit you against things like planes and choppers. The first, a race between a '70\u00a0Ford Mustang Boss 429 and a P-51 Mustang (a famously formidable\u00a0WWII-era fighter plane), is a true highlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of the festival you\u2019ll find a series of unsanctioned street races that take place on public roads with civilian cars present. These don\u2019t contribute to your Horizon Festival progress but score you more cash. Then there are instant challenges you can trigger whenever you see another Horizon competitor on the road. Just tuck in behind them and you\u2019ll be prompted with an invitation to challenge them. A waypoint will be deposited a few kilometres away and a one-on-one race will immediately begin. Depending on the car you\u2019re in, and the car they\u2019re in, you\u2019ll be warned just how easy or difficult the race will be before you proceed.\n\nImportantly, there are the online modes. Rivals mode lets you win extra bounty by beating the ghosts of friends and other players and should be familiar to those of you who\u2019ve played Forza 4. Forza Horizon features eight-player online racing but its Playground Games, like Forza\u2019s traditional Cat & Mouse and Virus modes, look set to be the stand-out feature.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not racing you can be painting and customising. The visual customisation system is just as deep as fans would expect, and vinyl groups can be imported from Forza 4 so you can go nuts right away.\n\nSpeaking of nuts...\n\nIf I were an outspoken yet hilarious UK motoring journalist I\u2019d probably say something outrageous at this point, like anybody who walks into a store from this day on and walks out with Test Drive Unlimited 2 instead of this should be sterilised; but I\u2019m not, so I won\u2019t.\n\nWhat I will say, however, is that Forza Horizon and Playground Games have rewritten the rules of the road. Thing is, Forza Horizon is exactly the type of game we\u2019ve been trained not to expect. We\u2019ve been conditioned to accept concessions. Increased scope for lesser quality visuals. Technical prowess for reduced content. We deal with Test Drive Unlimited 2\u2019s visual shortcomings because it\u2019s so enormous. We take the likes of the technically robust DiRT Showdown and make do with all the track recycling. None of this is the case with Forza Horizon. I don\u2019t know how a game of this size, with everything going on, can look this good and still support a rewind utility, fully functioning car interiors and a full day/night cycle. I don\u2019t know how the frame rate for this enormous game remains resolutely locked, because whether you\u2019re racing under headlights or screaming down the freeway at over 400 kilometres per hour it never, ever dips. It might as well be witchcraft. I don\u2019t know how it does it. It just does.\n\nIt\u2019s not without fault. Upgrades remain but tuning is out, which will likely disappoint some. Mechanical damage is out too. No-one is going to want to limp across Colorado in a busted car, but it does mean you can muscle your way through opponents in ways you\u2019d be hesitant to attempt in Forza 4. Speaking of damage, Forza Horizon also retains a weird quirk from Forza 4 where visibly smashed windscreens only appear so in chase cam; they appear unbroken in cabin view.\n\nThe clich\u00e9d rivals who trash talk you before a race are a relic of racing games gone by and feel pretty out of place here. I also reckon that the amazing Barn Find idea, where you track down rare cars in dire need of restoration hidden across Colorado, is honestly kind of wasted. It\u2019s an inspired concept but the Barn Finds in Forza Horizon are simply classics you probably already have in your Forza 4 garage. The Bugatti EB110, Shelby Daytona and Jaguar D-Type, for instance, are all rare birds, but it dulls the thrill somewhat when you drive to the marked area on the map, cruise around until you find a barn, then enter it only to find a car you own or have driven several times in Forza 4. You could mount an argument the Barn Finds really should\u2019ve been cars completely new to the franchise. Finding them would\u2019ve been far more exciting if they were.\n\nNot exactly rare, but definitely new to the series.\n\nThis really is minor stuff, though, especially when you look at Forza Horizon as a racing game to play as well as Forza 4, not instead of Forza 4.\n\nIf you love Forza 4, this is the perfect companion. If you love cars, this is essential. The school of thought may be that it\u2019s hard to push racing games this late in a generation, but Playground Games hasn\u2019t just moved the needle here. It\u2019s buried it.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the open road beckons. And racing developers of the world? Playground Games has just put you on notice.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "FIFA Soccer 13", "index": 75, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/fifa-2013/vita-115689", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/20/fifa-13-review", "review": "A fine balance trembles at the heart of every sports game. It\u2019s a constant, fiddly calibration to make a game that feels authentic yet also fun and accessible to play. Lean towards the former, and the experience could be as dreary as an afternoon sat on the damp terraces of Grimsby Town; favour the latter, and you might create fantastical fun but soon it\u2019ll feel cheap and unearned.\n\nSaying that, sport is a world in which the fantastical frequently comes to pass. Headlines can\u2019t be written. Tiny Davids slay gigantic franchises. And the reason for these unbelievable headlines? Unpredictability. It\u2019s one of the key innovations of FIFA 13. It\u2019s a risky, potentially game-breaking change, resulting in frustration and irritation, but those of both part of football. Thankfully, the balance is spot-on.\n\nThis unpredictability is at its most obvious when it comes to first-touch controls. Your players are no longer endowed with supernatural skill when it comes to taking balls out of the air or running onto passes at speed. If you don\u2019t use your skill, there\u2019s a pretty good chance they\u2019ll fumble the ball and lose possession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes the game immediately less accessible. You\u2019ll groan when your player takes a heavy touch when you\u2019re through on goal, but that\u2019s something which happens every week in the best leagues around the world. Yet it never becomes game-breaking or frustrating, and this is thanks to a rationale behind it all. Several factors conspire to determine the quality of your first-touch: speed of the pass, spin on the ball, the speed and relative skill of the player receiving it. Over time, you\u2019ll come to learn how to improve your first-touch \u2013 for instance, don\u2019t run on to a pass at full speed, or perhaps knock it on using the right analogue so you don\u2019t have to take you finger off sprint.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only gameplay innovation. Last year defending was a focus for change with the introduction of \u2018Tactical Defending\u2019. FIFA 13 concentrates on improving your attacking options. Dribbling has learnt from recent FIFA spinoff FIFA Street, and has incorporated it\u2019s free dribbling mechanic, which allows the player to have tighter control of the ball when you hold down both triggers. It takes a while to meld this with varying your pace on the ball and using precision dribbling (introduced last year) but once you learn how to use them in tandem, it become useful for skipping past players on the wings. But again the balancing seems right. Using this tighter dribbling mechanic doesn\u2019t ensure that you\u2019ll beat your man but used in the right context it can be extremely useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacking has also been improved by revamped offensive AI. When going forward, you\u2019ll have more support with your teammates making intelligent runs off the ball, even curving their runs to stay onside. It\u2019s most noticeable when you\u2019re on the break. A player will tear down the opposite flank, or run in between defenders, screaming for a pass to played. It makes games more exciting and open, letting you score goals that you simply couldn\u2019t before due to a lack of movement.\n\nThe whole game feels more physical, too. The Player Impact Engine \u2013 one of last year\u2019s marquee features \u2013 has been tightened up, and I haven\u2019t experienced any of the awkward, often humorous collisions that it occasionally produced it FIFA 12. This feeling of physicality, of brawn and weight to players, comes mainly from the fact that the ball no longer feels magnetised to the player in possession. Players can collide and jostle with each other as they chase free balls. When you\u2019re in defence, and receive the ball, you\u2019re more inclined to punt into to row Z for fear of taking a bad touch and the striker breathing down your neck. While improved attacking AI makes games more fluid, the added physicality can also make them scrappy affairs at times, with passages of play in which neither team can really dominate possession. The combination of these two elements introduces the variety you would expect in the real-world game.\n\nGraphically, FIFA 13 isn\u2019t a huge improvement on its immediate predecessor. But it does benefit considerably from new contextual animations \u2013 basically, players recover from challenges and react in situations as they would in real life\u00a0\u2013 sliding to keep a ball in play, for instance. It just helps sell the illusion that little bit more.\n\nThe changes this year aren\u2019t as bombastic as last year\u2019s headline features but they definitely not the product of restless tinkering. While FIFA 12 is still fun if you go back to it after playing 13 for a decent amount of time, play genuinely feels more restrictive and slightly mechanical in retrospect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIFA 13 is extremely generous to those who want a more committed football experience, not just a quick kick-around. It\u2019s a game swollen with content. Be A Pro, Ultimate Team, Tournaments from around the world\u2026 It\u2019s still all there. And there\u2019s even more this year. Skill Games are a really fun addition, covering all the fundamentals of the game, from crossing to passing to shooting. It even lets you get up to speed with the game\u2019s new tactical free kicks, in which you can use decoy runners. Each discipline has different bronze, silver, and gold challenges. They\u2019re not much a teaching aid, however, more an opportunity to practice and commit key skills to muscle memory. Once you\u2019ve earned your stripes, a \u2018Skill Challenge\u2019 is unlocked for that discipline allowing you to post a high score to share with your friends.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nWant to see more of the Skill Games? Watch them all in the IGN\u00a0FIFA 13 Wiki.\n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end \n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that FIFA 13 incorporates motion controls with varying degrees of success. Kinect works well. It's been implemented unobtrusively and in a way that makes sense. You're now both player \u2013 controller in hands \u2013 and manager, barking orders and tactics from the side-lines of your sofa. You can switch tactics during a match. Preset commands initiate strategic changes such as switching wingers. You can also map key motivational phrases - \"We need to win this\" - to prompt a combination of tweaks to formation, mentality and so on. Substitutions can be made using Kinect but this is where it gets a little messy to use mid-game. Say 'substitute' and you'll have to drill down through a series if menus in the corner in order to make the right switch. It's too distracting to use during a tightly-contested match and probably best saved for when the ball goes out of play.\n\nPlayStation Move, however, is incorporated less elegantly and less successfully. You use a Move wand to move your players around the pitch and point to where they should be passing the ball. It's difficult to pick up and having the colourful arrows used for aiming the Move controller frantically buzzing around the screen really undermines the illusion of the real game that FIFA strives towards creating.\n\nPresentation is slick and superb as you\u2019d come to expect. It does a good job of aping the bombastic style of Sky Sports, with dazzling idents and having additional sideline commentary giving you updates about injuries during matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years EA has strived to make its games into living, breathing organisms \u2013 experiences that persist once you switch off your console. One of FIFA 12\u2019s biggest innovations was Football Club, a series of topical challenges that were refreshed throughout the season. It returns, of course, but this year we also get Match Day, a service which attempts to keep FIFA 13 in touch with the season as it unfolds. When you boot up FIFA, you can turn it on with a click of a button and a short update will rebalance the stats of teams and individual players according to how they\u2019re faring in the league. For example, if a player hits form and starts scoring every week, his stats will soar. With features like this it\u2019s hard to assess their lasting value from the outset but if EA remains committed to it throughout the year and it\u2019s sensitively curated, then Match Day is ingenious and you\u2019ll wonder why it wasn\u2019t done sooner. FIFA 13 really aspires to be a true extension of the sport it simulates.\n\nSo FIFA 13 is a refinement of a winning formula rather than an entirely new equation. While the gameplay changes are more subtle, they really consolidate upon the success and innovation of FIFA 12. But that success hasn\u2019t bred laziness \u2013 there are new features, new services, even new leagues. If you\u2019re a fan of the sport or FIFA in general, it\u2019s hard to imagine a game that you\u2019ll enjoy more this year.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Mugen Souls", "index": 76, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/mugen-souls/ps3-120256", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/12/mugen-souls-review", "review": "There's simply no denying that our brothers in the East have a decidedly different view of the world than we do. So when a publisher takes the risk of localizing a title in the west that's clearly aimed at the Japaneses market, it's understandable that certain nuances can get lost in translation. Then again, we too often cite cultural differences as an excuse for poor writing, ugly visual design, or esoteric gameplay systems. Compile Heart's new RPG, Mugen Souls, is guilty of all these offenses and more, and none of it has anything to with the nationality of its creators or its intended audience.\n\nSometimes, a bad game is just a bad game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst impressions are always crucial and Mugen Souls fails to make a good one. It opens with an acid-induced bang \u2013 an airship with a giant bunny head mounted on the bow and a pair of seemingly underage girls performing a high energy J-pop number. Panty shots and face palms abound as the game tries ever-so-hard to be both funny and naughty, yet succeeds only in being juvenile and creepy. It's a trend you'll grow familiar with as you trudge through the vapid tale of Lady Chou-Chou, the self-proclaimed Undisputed God of the Universe whose only goal is to make every person she meets and everything she sees her loyal \u201cpeon\u201d.\n\nTo its credit, the game does take a few witty shots at common RPG tropes and even tries to wring some humor out of mild Sub/Dom relationships and sadomasochism. I actually appreciate it when games try to tackle topics that are largely considered taboo, but when delivered so ham-handedly from a cast of characters who look and act like they're 14, it comes off as fetishistic rather than satirical. \u201cAre you really going to peon me?\u201d one character excitedly asks Chou-Chou. The writing is just sophomoric enough for me to wonder if the decision to use the word \u201cpeon\u201d throughout the entire game instead of \u201chenchmen\u201d was made specifically to facilitate this pun.\n\nI think she likes you.\n\nAnd you will indeed hear the word peon a lot. There's nothing Lady Chou-Chou loves more than gathering new peons. She makes heroes and demon lords her peons. Continents, planet-spanning energy barriers and even random inanimate objects must all be brought into the fold. Naturally, she accomplishes this by determining what turns them on and transforming into a girl that suits their tastes. This is an actual gameplay mechanic used in place of the usual elemental affinities you see in other RPGs. Regardless of whether or not you find it conceptually insulting, it's a needlessly confusing system that unfortunately has to be dealt with often in order to maximize your party's effectiveness.\n\nOk, pop quiz, hot shot: what beats ice? (Hint: rhymes with ire!) Oh and I hear that water usually beats fire because, you know, SCIENCE! But in Mugen Souls, instead of easy to understand elements, we've got stuff like \u201cterse,\u201d \u201cgraceful,\u201d and \u201cbipolar\u201d. I mean, what the hell beats \u201cbipolar?\" \u201cHyper?\" \u201cSadist?\" It's not like it's impossible to work out, but it's still a layer of false complexity that doesn't add anything but confusion to the experience. The same can be said for nearly every one of the myriad systems the game introduces to you over the first 20 hours of the game.\n\nTake the Moe Kill system for example, which allows you to charm monsters in battle much like you would in a Shin Megami Tensei game. First, you need to transform Chou-Chou into the type of girl the monster likes, but doing so in combat is limited to a handful of uses, meaning constant switching is ill advised unless you want to keep heading back to your ship to replenish the ability. Once you've matched your affinity to the creature's tastes, you attempt the Moe Kill by picking a series of three vaguely described phrases to hurl at them. Not only do your available options seem random, but the monster itself has moods that change during each round of combat, further complicating the process. Even if you're making the right choices, it can take three turns or more to win him over, and because Chou-Chou is the only one who can do it, everyone else needs to target another monster or simply stand around and do nothing while she works her charms. I love systems like this in other games, but the way Mugen Souls handles it makes it so tedious, I could barely stand using it.\n\nWho doesn&#Array;t love a dance party?\n\nMuch like the Disgaea series, the game has a ton of moving parts to learn in order to get the most out of it. Such intricacy usually sucks me in and swallows me whole, but only if all the pieces fit together in a way that challenges me to make tough decisions while doling out appropriate rewards. In Mugen Souls, you can customize skill load-outs, exploit the status altering effects of crystals strewn across the battlefield, create and fuse new party members from a variety of jobs and classes, and much more. But after sitting through countless interminable tutorials, I couldn't help but feel like the same depth could have been achieved by less cumbersome means.\n\nDespite throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you, none if it seems to have as significant an impact on combat as you'd probably like. Ideally you would want to feel rewarded for taking the time to learn and apply advanced tactics, but at the end of the day, basic move and attack routines nearly always work well enough. Exploration and progression feel just as empty, as you do little more than follow a clearly marked breadcrumb trail of trigger points for the next inane cutscene or story event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd whether you're picking fights or wandering about, the game is an absolute eyesore. The environments are so sparse, and enemy models so basic, you'll be left wondering why the framerate is constantly in south-of-30 territory. Textures are flat, low resolution messes, and an overbearing blur filter makes anything not in the immediate foreground look like it's been smudged over with a whole jar of Vaseline. Whether you dig the aesthetic Compile Heart was going for or not, it's impossible to ignore how badly they failed at achieving it.\n\nIf you've been reading this review and thinking, \u201cThis guy just doesn't 'get' Japan,\u201d I implore you to reconsider -- not for the sake of my reputation, but for the sake of your wallet. This isn't about \u201canime bias\u201d, nor is it about culture shock. We could all argue until we were blue in the face about how things that are taboo here are accepted there or how different their sense of humor is from ours. That isn't the point. I got every joke in Mugen Souls, I just didn't find any of them terribly funny. Whether your tastes align more with the East or the West, poor game design is still poor game design. If you're dying to throw your cash up on the altar to show your support for the localization of niche RPGs, go right ahead. Just remember: I told you so.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

And in New Little King\u2019s Story, you \u2013 as that little king \u2013 hold all the cards. Even with your cache of advisors constantly chattering in your ear, everything that ends up happening in New Little King\u2019s Story is at the behest of you, the non-descript young man with the oversized crown and ornate clothing.\n\nSuch is the life of a young king, who gets thrust into an unusual situation almost immediately upon beginning the game, forcing him to rebuild his shattered realm. But the plot of New Little King\u2019s Story isn\u2019t what will keep you engaged; in fact, it\u2019s almost entirely unimportant. Rather, the game\u2019s very essence \u2013 creating, molding and controlling an ever-growing kingdom \u2013 will undoubtedly lure Vita gamers in. The thing is, while New Little King\u2019s Story draws you in with its complexity and promise of absolute, monarchial-like control, its cumbersome feel and hazy explanations weigh the game down considerably.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Little King\u2019s Story is essentially a reimagined version of a poor-selling Wii exclusive from back in 2009 also called Little King\u2019s Story. In that game, like in this incarnation, players must gain control of a continent, battling monsters, building and expanding your towns, and nurturing and growing a population that will help you on your conquest.\n\nMixing up elements from classics ranging from SimCity to Pikmin and beyond, New Little King\u2019s Story is an ambitious mixture of stat building, enemy slaying and city managing. The unfortunate thing about this concoction, however, is that New Little King\u2019s Story doesn\u2019t expertly execute any of its singular elements, leaving behind a package with exceptional promise that simply doesn\u2019t rise above simple mediocrity. It\u2019s a game that demands time and attention, but doesn\u2019t necessarily reward either.\n\nMany issues in New Little King\u2019s Story arise not from controlling the king himself \u2013 which proves rather simplistic -- but rather the craftsmen, artisans, soldiers, and serfs that make up the population of the expanding kingdom. The king can control various characters at once, but only in an inexact fashion. By forcing characters \u2013 farmers, soldiers, archers and the like \u2013 into his royal guard, the king acquires much-needed assistance in dealing with the problems on his kingdom\u2019s ever-changing frontier. He can thrust his soldiers into battle with foes, have his farmers dig up holes to find hidden treasures, use his lumberjacks to fell trees, employ his merchants in finding hidden stashes of booty and much more.\n\nOnward, little soldiers.\n\nThis all sounds fun \u2013 and in premise, it truly is \u2013 but it\u2019s the way everything\u2019s actually executed that holds New Little King\u2019s Story back. These characters vital to the success of the kingdom are controlled in about the most wonky way imaginable, with little to govern the specifics of their mission. Hurdling a soldier towards an enemy requires no error in trajectory; a few pixels off and the game isn\u2019t smart enough to know what you wanted to do, sending the soldier past your enemy and into the nearest object. If you\u2019re too close to something you want to interact with, such as a building in which to change your character\u2019s class, your followers are more liable to smash into the building rather than enter it, even if it\u2019s entirely obvious what you\u2019re attempting to do. This isn\u2019t a game controlled via the pinpoint nature of a mouse; the game needed to take into account the more finicky nature of dual analog sticks.\n\nSimilar annoyances can be found with just about everything else you\u2019d want your kingdom\u2019s population to undertake. There\u2019s simply a frustrating and confusing lack of real control present, which is troubling in a game that requires the mastery of specific actions and deeds to expand your kingdom. Compounding the issue is the lack of real explanation of features that end up becoming rather important, such as equipping weapons and gear on your followers. New Little King\u2019s Story, no matter how promising what it\u2019s attempting to do is, can\u2019t help but sink underneath the muddled weight of so many missed opportunities, especially because the game gets exceptionally more dynamic and complicated the more you play it. As riveting as slaying whimsical creatures and partaking in digital imperialism can be, the fundamentals aren\u2019t sound enough to draw out a flood of player enjoyment.\n\nStill, even when fighting the controls and the lack of explanation of much of what you\u2019re doing, New Little King\u2019s Story can be fun in limited ways. Expanding the kingdom slowly, surely and through lots of trial and error proves exceptionally satisfying. Rescuing helpless princesses and undertaking a litany of quests can keep you focused on the tasks at hand. Things aren\u2019t at all helped out by a muddy, imprecise map and tutorials that border, at times, on the incoherent. But those with patience enough to stick around for more than a few hours to really get the hang of New Little King\u2019s Story may be ready to completely excuse its inability to gel and explain everything. In fact, few games in recent memory had me vacillate between having fun, enjoying myself, being bored, being frustrated and more. Fighting the game\u2019s lackluster controls and general ambiguity can result in a win for gamers, though it\u2019s painfully obvious that most players won\u2019t want to see it through long enough to get to that point, nor should they have to when there are so many other titles begging for their attention.\n\nA good enough reason to me.\n\nIn short, New Little King\u2019s Story simply doesn\u2019t hold a candle to a portion of Vita\u2019s library that demands your attention, and it\u2019s hard to argue that it\u2019s worth its high, $40 price of admission. That puts it in the top rank of expensive games on PlayStation Vita, but it certainly falls well short of the best Vita games in terms of quality. With that much money to burn, you could buy some of the handheld\u2019s finest games \u2013 Escape Plan, Super Stardust Delta, and more \u2013 and still have money to spare. Going in that direction seems like a smarter bet than making a significant investment in time and money with New Little King\u2019s Story.\n\nAt the end of the day, New Little King\u2019s Story is a confusing product. Underneath its imprecise, under-explained gameplay and overpriced point of entry is a really promising game that could have been so much better. Much like the tower defense genre or grinding out levels in an RPG, what New Little King\u2019s Story attempts to do \u2013 craft a kingdom out of nothing \u2013 is something a substantial group of Vita owners (and gamers in general) would want to do any day of the week. It attempts to hit a note that would resonate with the hardcore gaming masses, but it falls short, and should only be purchased by those desperate for an experience like it on Vita.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "Fable: The Journey", "index": 78, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/fable-the-journey/xbox-360-27948", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/09/fable-the-journey-review", "review": "Considering how Kinect was supposed to be \u201cmagical,\u201d perhaps it\u2019s fitting that the motion controller\u2019s first genuine peace offering to \u201cgamer\u2019s gamers\u201d is, in fact, centered on magic. It\u2019s true \u2013 Fable: The Journey is a real game about casting magic that happens to be played with Kinect (while sitting down, even). It\u2019s neither a gimmick nor an exercise app. But the key question with any Kinect title is, of course: does it work?\n\nThe good news, particularly after the Hindenburg-level disaster that Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor was, is that yes, most of the time it works. Grabbing the series\u2019 classic Hobbes (think \u201cdwarfish orcs\u201d) and tossing them over ledges with your left hand Tether spell is hilariously delightful. Even more fun is lassoing onto Hollow Men skeletons, because you can sadistically and systematically dismantle them; pull left to yank the sword-holding arms out of their bony sockets, then right to literally disarm their shields by taking that arm off, and then up to pop their heads off until only an armless torso wanders over and tries to kick you. Then you can finish them off with one of the three attack spells on your right hand. It genuinely makes you feel like a spellcasting badass. A clever mechanic called Aftertouch even lets you throw spells out straight ahead of you and then wave your hand in a different direction in order to curve the magic projectile around corners and hit monsters cowering behind cover.\n\nBetter still, you\u2019ll not only unlock two additional spells over the course of the campaign \u2013 a fireball and a magic shard \u2013 but you\u2019ll also level them all up with Upgrade Points, adding extra shards and more damage to your attacks. It helps keep the game from growing repetitive and only makes you feel like more of a mighty mage. (Tip: I recommend not investing any points in the Horse Upgrade skill; you won\u2019t need them and your precious points are better spent on buffing your spells and health.)\n\nDuring one section near the end, for instance, with the fully upgraded magic arsenal at my disposal and Kinect firing on all cylinders in my gaming space, I faced down a pack of fast-leaping Balverine wolves. I grabbed one with my left hand and spun it, sending him into a dizzy, stunned state. At the same time, I cocked my right arm back to charge my default magic ball attack spell, brought my hand back above my shoulder to switch to the Magic Shard (I could\u2019ve also said \u201cMagic Shard\u201d), then flung the javelin-like projectile out to my right and waved my right hand back to the left to activate Aftertouch, sending the upgraded shard\u2019s three barbs to each hit one of the three enemies. I finished two of them off by quickly blasting them with rapid-fire bolts, and then the third one charged me. It leaped into the air. I turned my left shoulder towards the screen to block, sending it reeling backwards. I raised my right hand, said \u201cFireball\u201d to conjure my most potent offensive attack, then flung my arm forward to send the projectile out, where it impacted the last wolf and exploded it in a glorious burst of flame.\n\nBoss fights are also a highlight, as the handful of screen-filling bad guys \u2013 while never particularly difficult \u2013 requires you to simultaneously juggle all of your abilities. The Troll, for example, tasks you with using the left-hand Tether to yank stalactites down to use as giant nails while avoiding flung boulders, and you\u2019ll need to pierce the winged she-monster Corrupter in the neck with fireballs while dodging gargoyles.\n\nHollow Men are among the most fun enemies to fight, because you can rip off both their arms as well as their heads.\n\nSuch are The Journey\u2019s best-case scenarios, which are in effect about 75% of the time. The problem is that, as you\u2019ve come to expect from Kinect, the motion-controller\u2019s accuracy sometimes becomes unpredictable for no apparent reason \u2013 no matter how ideal your setup. Strangely, it seems as if the longer you play, the more likely you are to encounter a problem. You\u2019ll try to aim a spell at the center of the screen and it will instead go to the far left or right edge. You can recalibrate through the main menu, but woefully, you have to quit out of the campaign to do it. I recommend using the default calibration settings \u2013 which still require you to go through the same two-minute configuration process.\n\nBoss fights are among The Journey&#Array;s highlights.\n\nStory-wise, as both the name and Kinect controls imply, The Journey is a spinoff. It\u2019s not Fable 4, and that means it\u2019s not an open-world adventure. You have no dog \u2013 only a horse \u2013 and the gameplay is completely on-rails. Rather than a 15-30 hour epic with ample replayability and the choice to be good or evil like in the mainline Fables, The Journey is a straightforward 8-10 hour quest with two gameplay tenets: riding through Albion aboard your horse-drawn cart and the already-discussed on-foot spellcasting.\n\nYou play Gabriel, a rather typical unwitting young-man-turned-hero who eventually embraces his fate. Guiding him through the archetypal plot is Fable staple Theresa, the blind, ageless seer whose storyline ends up being far more interesting for Fable fans. Along the way, The Journey does its best to replicate Fable\u2019s trademark playful and juvenile sense of humor, but most of its pun-based jokes only manage to elicit a soft chuckle.\n\nWhat The Journey does nail, however, is Fable\u2019s charming art style. As it\u2019s essentially the chronicle of one long road trip, it\u2019s important that the scenery be impressive. It is. Trademark sunset lighting gives The Journey that classic golden Fable glow, be it along a seaside coastline or through the woods.\n\nWhen everything is in sync, you&#Array;ll feel like Gandalf on a power trip.\n\nBut of course, gameplay revolves around the Kinect. The Journey starts a bit slow, with the better part of the game\u2019s first hour spent in your horse-drawn cart, manning the reins for Seren, your beloved equine. The game\u2019s carriage sequences consist solely of steering by pulling your hands forward or back to turn. It\u2019s a minimal amount of work once you realize that Seren will mostly auto-steer you in the right direction. These sections end up mostly being used as plot-advancing devices, though a host of stylized cutscenes will also serve this purpose.\n\nUltimately, I really enjoyed my trip through Fable\u2019s motion-controlled spinoff, even if it was peppered with bouts of Kinect-ified frustration. Despite numerous in-game rest stops that attempted to emotionally bond me to my steed via wound-healing touches and brush-down grooming sessions, I never cared for my horse a tenth as much as I did for my Fable II/III dog aside from one touching moment at the very end. Still, solid boss fights, charming art, and a truly empowering spellcasting mechanic make Fable: The Journey the first step in the long process of rebuilding a trust between Kinect and hardcore gamers.\n\nTake the following away from this review if nothing else: The Journey is a legitimately fun game that happens to be played with Kinect\u2026when the hardware works properly. It simply won\u2019t at times, though, and while that shouldn't stop you from giving it a try, it is something you should prepare for.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
{"game": "The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan", "index": 79, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan/pc-127207", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/27/lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan-review", "review": "Riders of Rohan is an expansion about departures. We see it in the breaking of Frodo\u2019s Fellowship in the opening chapters of the expansion\u2019s epic story, and we witness Turbine themselves taking their leave of much of the core design that\u2019s sustained their Tolkien-themed MMORPG until now. The old focus on class abilities for LOTRO\u2019s increasingly dated ground combat has passed like rain on the mountain, you might say, as has the old tradition of end-game raids. In their place rears up a relentless focus on mounted combat and a casual-oriented endgame that involves rebuilding a ruined Rohirrim city. It\u2019s a gamble clearly meant to maintain LOTRO\u2019s relevance in an MMORPG market that\u2019s increasingly crowded with worthy competitors, and for the most part, it paid off.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that all the action takes place in such a memorable and powerful setting. Last year\u2019s Rise of Isengard only flirted with Saruman and his iconic phallic tower; most of the rest of the expansion courted the Dunlendings, the unwashed hill people that casual Tolkien enthusiasts know only from their five or so minutes of onscreen yowling in Peter Jackson\u2019s trilogy. But if Rise of Isengard was a Hobbit-sized expansion, Riders of Rohan is a cave troll. You sense its grandeur from the moment you cross the Anduin into Rohan and witness the rolling prairies of the Wold unraveling far into the distance, and you feel it in Chance Thomas\u2019 haunting 22-track score, which punctuates the empty moors and farms of East Rohan with manly choruses and Nordic fiddles.. This sense of epic adventure seeps through the stunning Anglo-Saxon/Viking-style woodwork and tapestries that adorn the region\u2019s scattered mead halls, and it manifests itself in a landscape that\u2019s twice as large as the Mines of Moria expansion.\n\nA new way to play.\n\nThe need for all that elbow room reveals itself the moment you acquire your warsteed following a brief phased questline. Warsteeds, you\u2019ll quickly realize, aren\u2019t anything like normal MMORPG mounts, which might as well be glorified speed boosts that allow unrealistic sudden stops and split-second switchbacks. By contrast, warsteeds behave more like real horses, complete with four speeds ranging from walk to gallop and wide, arcing turns at full speed, and such a realistic design demands far more space than zones designed for foot combat allow. True, they take some getting used to. There\u2019s a learning curve involved that still makes me prefer the old style mounts while in the cramped trappings of the villages, but the steeds come into their own in the grasses of East Rohan. They gallop, slow, and fight in a style that more strongly recalls Red Dead Redemption than Mount and Blade, as the MMORPG format allows Turbine to capture the best aspects of what made RDR\u2019s multiplayer mode such a hit in 2010. There\u2019s even considerable depth beneath the saddle, as players can choose between light, medium, and heavy bridles that roughly correspond to DPS, healing, and tanking respectively, each with its own talent trees that unlock new skills or refine abilities such as the sharpness of your warsteed\u2019s turns.\n\nAll this would be a snore if everyone had the same skills, but Turbine tailored steeds to sport specific combat abilities that capture the essence of each of LOTRO\u2019s nine classes on horseback, which explains the near absence of new abilities for ground combat. In Riders of Rohan, your warsteed effectively takes the place of your character, and while it\u2019s possible to complete all of the expansion\u2019s content on foot, the mobility involved ensures that you can down foes that would grind you into paste out of the saddle. Quite frankly, it\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve had in LOTRO since Moria, and it\u2019s exciting enough that I count my many hours with RoR\u2019s mounted combat as some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in an MMORPG this year. It\u2019s so good that ground combat now seems unforgivably dull. As a hunter, I spend almost every battle racing at top speed on my light steed, making wide swoops around foes as I pelt them with arrows safely out of reach, and if I\u2019m feeling particularly bold, I rush in with my one melee ability and smite them in the face in a head-on rush. Melee classes, unfortunately, appear to have it rougher. Burglars are particularly vocal about their general dissatisfaction with mounted combat, complaining that their class\u2019 squishiness doesn\u2019t mesh well with their warsteed abilities involving close combat.\n\nBut if there\u2019s a silver lining that even burglars can appreciate, it\u2019s that Riders of Rohan is an intensely social expansion that does its best to ensure that you\u2019re rarely fighting alone. For Rohan only, Turbine took a page from Guild Wars 2 by granting loot and XP to all players who contributed to a kill regardless of whether they were grouped or not, along with instant quests that pop up when you\u2019re near relevant enemies. These decisions, coupled with the removal of the need to stop and loot slain enemies, complement the frenetic nature of mounted combat, and they\u2019ve fostered a greater sense of cooperation in a game that\u2019s already known for its uncommonly good community. It especially comes in handy for the expansion\u2019s warbands. Warbands are mini-bosses of a sort, who either patrol the prairies alone or surround themselves with multiple lackeys of varying power, and coming across them ignites a touch of the same novelty that surrounds Guild Wars 2\u2019s dynamic events.\n\nSome especially impressive sights in LOTRO&#Array;s new zones.\n\nYet the big question mark looming over all this is the reconstruction of the burned village of Hytbold, which constitutes Riders of Rohan\u2019s endgame in the absence of coordinated raids. There\u2019s a definite sense of progression involved in that you repair Hytbold to former glory through phasing by completing five daily quests spread across the four main regions of East Rohan (which in turn unlock vendors for end-game armor in preparation for the eventual release of new instances), but it\u2019s directed at the apparently larger crowd that enjoys LOTRO\u2019s player housing and unrivaled sense of place rather than at the more hardcore players who enjoy raiding. The quests themselves afford entertaining diversions--set in public instances, they strike a nice middle ground between rote kill-and-fetch quests and more original pastimes such as mounted races--but there\u2019s the unmistakable odor of a grind settling over the whole affair. Elsewhere, it\u2019s hard to dismiss the realization that a new Skirmish featuring mounted combat would have been an excellent addition, as would some kind of mounted PvP option.\n\nLOTRO\u2019s epic quest--the mostly instanced succession of original storylines paralleling the Fellowship\u2019s trek to Mordor--also picks up new momentum on the journey from level 75 to 85, and lore buffs will enjoy seeing the most we\u2019ve seen of Frodo in the game for several updates. It\u2019s all done extraordinarily well, ranging from a darkly humorous sequence featuring the Fellowship as seen through Boromir\u2019s dismissive eyes to late night forays against the orcs with Rohirrim, and Turbine does a good job of justifying the expansion\u2019s combat by explaining that Theoden has outlawed any action against the marauding orcs. The storyline also permits the showcasing of Tolkien\u2019s most famous showpieces, ranging from the solemn visages of the Argonath to the breathtaking interior of Edoras, which easily nabs the prize for the most impressive visuals seen in Lord of the Rings Online to date.\n\nLOTRO still delivers excellent story-driven content.\n\nIt\u2019s a massive achievement of an expansion then, but it\u2019s tainted by the realization is that you\u2019ll have to wait until around level 75 before you can experience the thrills of LOTRO\u2019s new mounted combat. For all of its wonders, Riders of Rohan seems crafted to please LOTRO\u2019s existing playerbase rather than entice new folks to the fellowship, and new players marveling at the customizable warsteeds in old hubs like Bree can\u2019t even see them in action because their combat skills don\u2019t work in the older zones. The new additions are worth the journey for newcomers, but getting there will take hours of leveling along with the purchase of most quest packs until Rohan, capped off with an optional choice to buy one of three Rohan expansion packages with varying goodies ranging from $39.99 to $69.99. There\u2019s good news for free-to-play characters, though: provided you\u2019re at the appropriate level, you can experience both the epic questline and the new warsteeds for free.\n\nStill, it's tough to appreciate the wonders of Rohan when you\u2019re jogging about the five-year-old landscapes of Bree-land and Ered Luin. Rohan itself occasionally achieves stunning visual beauty as in the claustrophobic brambles of Fangorn Forest (one of the few new zones that prohibit mounted combat) but the old world looks increasingly pitiful in comparison. It\u2019s even more jarring when you consider the outdated character models, which trot around the endgame with magnificently textured armor draped over models that look like beginner\u2019s assignments for rendering courses. Were they not aware of what lies in wait on the long road ahead, it\u2019s not unreasonable to believe that new players might be shy away from the commitment of leveling based on the ghastly primitive early gear alone.\n\nRiders of Rohan is a forceful testament to Lord of the Rings Online\u2019s enduring capacity to deliver a uniquely rewarding MMORPG experience, which comes as welcome news after the disappointments of Rise of Isengard. Massive, beautiful, and graced with some of the best mounted combat ever seen in an MMORPG, Turbine\u2019s labor of love recalls the sense of exploration and adventure that\u2019s always set LOTRO apart. Its revised endgame won\u2019t satisfy players more accustomed to a hardcore raiding framework and the Hytbold quests eventually feel like a grind, but players looking to lose themselves in a vividly realized MMORPG with refreshingly unique gameplay will find few better alternatives.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

Not necessarily for the gameplay aspects, but for the fact that my eyes and ears never went a moment without being completely entertained. DOOM 3 is extremely immersive with about as perfect a presentation as I've ever seen in a game. Visually, it has no peer at the moment. Even Far Cry's impressive vistas and wonderful environments can't stand up to the artistic and technical might of this sensory feast. Playing this on a 5.1 surround sound in the dark is an intense experience that, if possible, must be enjoyed. \n\n Without the atmosphere, DOOM 3 is a plain shooter that hearkens back to those of the '90s. Certainly, that's what id was trying to do, and they've done it. While I don't appreciate those types of shooters as much as I used to, it didn't really matter. I was drawn in and addicted almost completely from the moment that nameless marine arrived at Mars City to the moment the final credits began rolling. \n\n The original DOOM, when released in 1993 on DOS, helped to start a wave that swept PC gaming. First-person shooters were still just a twinkle in the gaming industry's eye, and DOOM, while not the first of them, really kicked the genre into high gear. Eleven years later, id has finished developing its remake of the original game, this time with a state-of-the-art graphics engine and a lot of talented people. \n\n It turns out, the first impressions I wrote the other day were not too far off to my final opinions of the game. The shift in opinion was towards the positive however, mainly to do with the increasing level of creepiness, the fact that the art actually kept getting better than it was at the beginning and the pacing was very good. The action was fairly repetitive and AI was not the most impressive (I'll get more into my thoughts about that in a minute), but by the end of the game, I just didn't care. I was having a great time being in that environment while mindlessly blasting mindless creatures. \n\nLinks :: Video Review | Uncut High-Res :: \n\n The environment in which the game takes place is really the high point here, but it's a very, very high point. Not only is the technology that renders everything in the game amazing, even on low settings, but the actual art is beyond good. The design and art team kicked ass over every part of this game, even managing to throw in an ode to the old box art in an unlikely place. \n\n poilib start \n\n poilib end   Everything about DOOM 3 oozes dread. Even if I hadn't known what this game was all about when starting it, I'm pretty sure I would have felt that something was terribly wrong. After the first few emails left in a PDA, that feeling becomes cemented and then it's just a matter of time before the stuff hits the fan. \n\n The choice to make the station on Mars look industrial and depressing was obviously deliberate. This station must have had the highest suicide rate of anywhere in the galaxy outside of Hong Kong. No bright spots cheer the complex web of connecting labs. Tubes, pipes, steam vents, grates, and tons of metal sheeting are the theme. It's oppressive and a testament to the unnatural nature of the events to take place. In some ways the art reminds me a lot of another Hell in space movie called Event Horizon. A lot of the same artistic feel, though the actual movie was terrible.     \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

It needs to take a fast, highly kinetic sport like rugby league and turn it into a video game for the same sort of budget the developers of the FIFA series presumably allocate to keeping pace with Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s haircuts.\n\nThe disparities in the budgets of Big Ant\u2019s Rugby League Live series and top tier sporting kings like FIFA 13 and NBA 2K13 aren\u2019t reflected at the cash register though; Rugby League Live 2 sells for just as much as its big bucks rivals. With that comes a level of expectation fans are entitled to possess.\n\n2010\u2019s Rugby League Live was poor on most fronts; light on features and plagued by frustrating gameplay quirks. Two years down the track and Rugby League Live 2 is a noticeably better effort. It still falls well short of great but it has improved in most areas. In some cases, significantly so.\n\nThe visual makeover is likely the first thing you\u2019ll notice; the presentation has come along and there\u2019s more detail in the players, who\u2019ll be glistening with perspiration at the end of a match. Likenesses range in quality but the NRL\u2019s most popular players are generally recognisable. Pre-game flourishes before big clashes help too; it adds to the atmosphere to see rep squads emerging from the tunnel through a phalanx of cheerleaders and a cyclone of confetti. The graphics won\u2019t knock your teeth out but Rugby League Live 2 is certainly several steps up from its predecessor.\n\nMore important than looks, however, is the gameplay. The news here is mixed. Players no longer seem to teleport into tackles or skate around as much and, while the whole thing can\u2019t quite shake that 2002 pre-canned feeling, the game speed and player movement certainly go further to resemble the sport far more than the original Rugby League Live ever did.\n\nTackling is one area of noticeable improvement. You\u2019ve now got a low tackle that\u2019s hard to fend but allows for offloads if you don\u2019t get a second man in, as well as an arm-pinning tackle that will wrap the ball up but is easier to evade. There\u2019s also a diving tackle for last-gasp try-savers. The best thing about the whole system is that you can now hold tackled players down to slow the pace and allow your team to get back onside.\n\nPassing has been tweaked but unfortunately it\u2019s surprisingly unreliable. The pass buttons themselves seem just as annoyingly fickle as ever and, more often than not, seem to simply ignore your instructions. Spreading the ball from the ruck or from a scrum is handled fairly well, with onscreen guide lines indicating where a player is going to run and face buttons over their heads allowing you to easily choose your receiver and throw a cut-out pass. Unfortunately, the quick pass left or right always seems to catch your first receiver with no momentum, and the deep cut-out passes are no better; they\u2019re a safe pass at the expense of forward velocity. You can snap away flat cut-out passes to have your players running onto the ball with speed but the risk of interception ramps up to unacceptable levels. Interceptions in general in Rugby League Live 2 are far, far too common; they\u2019re incredibly frustrating and make flat cut-out passes generally too risky to bother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also seems impossible to make any metres out of dummy half because you can\u2019t play the ball with any real urgency; the dummy half always seems too bogged down. It\u2019d be good to see the quick one-handed pick up/dash out of dummy half from last generation\u2019s Rugby League 2 return. The sidestep is weird with players often weaving in a different direction to the one you specified with the stick. There\u2019s something awry with whatever logic is positioning the players, too. For instance, for reasons unknown, we lost track of how many times we caught Dragons prop Michael Weyman hovering out on the wing, and that\u2019s just one example.\n\nAnnoyingly, Rugby League Live 2\u2019s Training Mode doesn\u2019t cover everything you can actually do in the game, meaning several of the game\u2019s features go mostly unexplained. The manual and the loading screens contain advice on how to pull off shoulder charges and strips, for instance, but there\u2019s no practical demonstration of either.\n\nOne-on-one strips are basically pointless anyway; there\u2019s no clear indication when you contest the ball, and even when you do realise you\u2019re struggling for it the system for doing so is pretty ill thought out. The button you need to hammer to strip the ball is the same button for chip kick, so if and when you ever manage to successfully pull off a one-on-one strip it\u2019s followed by an unintended, low-percentage chip kick that\u2019ll probably turnover the possession you just won.\n\nOnline things get murky. It\u2019s possible to get a decent back-and-forth game going but the game\u2019s problematic quirks do seem to be exacerbated by the variables of the online environment; instances of teleporting balls and teleporting players were far more common than we\u2019d have liked. On one occasion we suffered from several seconds of confusion as an opponent player began to bamf around like Nightcrawler well over the sideline, and shonky turnovers are also pretty common. It appears impossible to hold down an online opponent in a tackle for anywhere near as long as you can in the offline game, which will result in plenty of penalties until you learn to immediately remove your finger from the tackle button the instant you opponent hits the grass. We also found some online players already relying heavily on exploits they\u2019ve picked up, like a sure fire way of getting possession from their own short kick-off. It may be worth keeping a list handy of any grubs you come across in order to more easily avoid them in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best additions to Rugby League Live 2, however, is the Career Mode \u2013 a mode that was completely absent in Big Ant\u2019s last attempt. Here you\u2019re able to take control of a franchise and steer it through 10 seasons; signing players, managing rosters, balancing training budgets with sponsorship cash, all that jazz. You\u2019ll also be able to choose your allegiances for rep games throughout the year and play these when they come up in the schedule. It\u2019s pretty standard stuff but welcome nonetheless.\n\nBig Ant has also added a range of comps that were unavailable in the original Rugby League Live so the Australian under-20s Toyota Cup, NSW Cup and Intrust Super Cup plus the English Championship and Championship One divisions are back alongside the top flight NRL and Super League comps. This, combined with the fairly robust customisation tools, will allow the truly dedicated to fiddle with this game indefinitely. You can\u2019t have more than 16 teams in the NRL (so you\u2019ll have to replace current ones) but editing rosters and creating fantasy NRL comps featuring previous NRL clubs like the Western Suburbs Magpies or the North Sydney Bears, for instance, is easy. You can create past teams from scratch too, aided by the inclusion of classic past team logos for the Illawarra Steelers, Western Reds, and more.\n\nThe addition of a second caller brings Rugby League Live 2\u2019s commentary up to the bare minimum you\u2019d expect in a sports game. The game-day feel of Tru-Blu\u2019s Rugby League series has always suffered due to its reliance on a single-commentator so pairing Andrew Voss with Phil Gould has alleviated that marginally. Unfortunately it\u2019s still horribly repetitive and largely unconvincing. All too often it just sounds like they\u2019re sticking far too rigidly to a script, and recycled phrases kick in almost instantly. It\u2019s kind of one-speed too; too restrained. Stealing a win after the siren should have the commentators assaulting their microphones in excitement. What you get instead is Gus Gould banging on about gypsies.\n\nAs far as improvements go this is a sizeable one, but the original was admittedly a total turkey. Rugby League Live was a game that just wasn\u2019t worth persisting with; it played poorly and there were no modes that encouraged you to keep playing it. Rugby League Live 2 is a step up. It plays better and features far more content. The problem is it\u2019s still inconsistent.\n\nThere are moments where it all falls into place. Tossing up a last second offload after the siren to beat the fullback to the corner for a game-winning try. Executing a perfectly weighted grubber to narrowly avoid being bustled into touch by a covering defender and beating him to the in-goal area for some highlight reel sizzle. Sometimes Rugby League Live 2 gets it right. Then a wild pass will zoom 60 metres through the air, from the middle of the field to deep in the crowd, or the AI will kick a 90 metre field goal from their own 10 metre line. These glitches don't happen every game, but they do happen.\n\nRugby League Live 2 is enjoyable, really, but only when it\u2019s behaving. \n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}

It needs to take a fast, highly kinetic sport like rugby league and turn it into a video game for the same sort of budget the developers of the FIFA series presumably allocate to keeping pace with Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s haircuts.\n\nThe disparities in the budgets of Big Ant\u2019s Rugby League Live series and top tier sporting kings like FIFA 13 and NBA 2K13 aren\u2019t reflected at the cash register though; Rugby League Live 2 sells for just as much as its big bucks rivals. With that comes a level of expectation fans are entitled to possess.\n\n2010\u2019s Rugby League Live was poor on most fronts; light on features and plagued by frustrating gameplay quirks. Two years down the track and Rugby League Live 2 is a noticeably better effort. It still falls well short of great but it has improved in most areas. In some cases, significantly so.\n\nThe visual makeover is likely the first thing you\u2019ll notice; the presentation has come along and there\u2019s more detail in the players, who\u2019ll be glistening with perspiration at the end of a match. Likenesses range in quality but the NRL\u2019s most popular players are generally recognisable. Pre-game flourishes before big clashes help too; it adds to the atmosphere to see rep squads emerging from the tunnel through a phalanx of cheerleaders and a cyclone of confetti. The graphics won\u2019t knock your teeth out but Rugby League Live 2 is certainly several steps up from its predecessor.\n\nMore important than looks, however, is the gameplay. The news here is mixed. Players no longer seem to teleport into tackles or skate around as much and, while the whole thing can\u2019t quite shake that 2002 pre-canned feeling, the game speed and player movement certainly go further to resemble the sport far more than the original Rugby League Live ever did.\n\nTackling is one area of noticeable improvement. You\u2019ve now got a low tackle that\u2019s hard to fend but allows for offloads if you don\u2019t get a second man in, as well as an arm-pinning tackle that will wrap the ball up but is easier to evade. There\u2019s also a diving tackle for last-gasp try-savers. The best thing about the whole system is that you can now hold tackled players down to slow the pace and allow your team to get back onside.\n\nPassing has been tweaked but unfortunately it\u2019s surprisingly unreliable. The pass buttons themselves seem just as annoyingly fickle as ever and, more often than not, seem to simply ignore your instructions. Spreading the ball from the ruck or from a scrum is handled fairly well, with onscreen guide lines indicating where a player is going to run and face buttons over their heads allowing you to easily choose your receiver and throw a cut-out pass. Unfortunately, the quick pass left or right always seems to catch your first receiver with no momentum, and the deep cut-out passes are no better; they\u2019re a safe pass at the expense of forward velocity. You can snap away flat cut-out passes to have your players running onto the ball with speed but the risk of interception ramps up to unacceptable levels. Interceptions in general in Rugby League Live 2 are far, far too common; they\u2019re incredibly frustrating and make flat cut-out passes generally too risky to bother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also seems impossible to make any metres out of dummy half because you can\u2019t play the ball with any real urgency; the dummy half always seems too bogged down. It\u2019d be good to see the quick one-handed pick up/dash out of dummy half from last generation\u2019s Rugby League 2 return. The sidestep is weird with players often weaving in a different direction to the one you specified with the stick. There\u2019s something awry with whatever logic is positioning the players, too. For instance, for reasons unknown, we lost track of how many times we caught Dragons prop Michael Weyman hovering out on the wing, and that\u2019s just one example.\n\nAnnoyingly, Rugby League Live 2\u2019s Training Mode doesn\u2019t cover everything you can actually do in the game, meaning several of the game\u2019s features go mostly unexplained.
