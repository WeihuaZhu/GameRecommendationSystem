{"game": "NHL 13", "index": 2, "gameurl": "https://www.ign.com/games/nhl-13/xbox-360-128182", "review_url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/11/nhl-13-review", "review": "NHL fans are staring down the barrel of another lost season. Team owners and the players association stand at each other\u2019s throats for the second time in under a decade, and neither side seems willing to bend. For those of us obsessed with our respective hockey teams (go Isles!) and deeply saddened by the prospect of being forced to watch the NBA, NHL 13 may be the only place we can go for respite. And that\u2019s the first dose of good news loyal NHL fans have received in a while, because real hockey or not, NHL 13 is a fun, engaging and deep iteration of the world\u2019s best sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight off the bat, you\u2019ll notice some old fallbacks that you can jump right into. Play a scrimmage against the AI or a friend, start a season as any team you choose, or jump into the role of general manager and control your organization\u2019s destiny from the front office (and cozy sky box). The latter is a mode I spent a considerable amount of time with this year, bringing my beloved New York Islanders through a season and into an unexpected playoff berth. But in playing actual games on the ice as opposed to managing from the tranquility of a quiet, digital office, I came to enjoy the more overt tweaks and fixes EA made this year to make NHL 13 a more realistic experience.\n\nThis new dose of realism is derived from what EA calls \"True Performance Skating.\" Developer buzzterm aside, True Performance Skating marks a paradigm shift in the series by making the very act of skating less arcadey and more realistic. That means no more turning on a dime when barreling full speed towards the boards or shadowing a rushing player without sacrificing some modicum of control. What it does mean \u2013 easily understandable to anyone who grew up playing hockey \u2013 is that speed sacrifices control, and staying in control, in turn, sacrifices speed.\n\nSuch a system changes the way you\u2019ll play NHL 13, but you\u2019ll quickly adapt to this more realistic take. Hockey is a positional game \u2013 far more than casual fans understand it to be \u2013 and NHL 13 forces your hand by making you play it as such or reaping the consequences of failing to do so. Instead of playing the body while skating backwards into your own zone, you may opt to play it angularly, sacrificing an easy-to-save shot you know your goalie can handle instead of going in for the check, and likely missing in the process. Likewise, dumping-and-chasing won\u2019t be so much about a straight skate for the puck, but instead knowing when you\u2019re beat and subsequently letting off the gas a bit. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be left in the dust during the ensuing rush.\n\nA fundamental change like this works well, but it\u2019s also admittedly (if only mildly) confusing. NHL 13 isn\u2019t a simulation; it\u2019s an arcade-style hockey game supplemented with a heavy dose of realism. The opposing team almost never ices the puck or goes offside. Goalies regularly dish a covered puck back out to his defenders, hockey logic (and puck safety) be damned. And passes aren\u2019t only tape-to-tape; they\u2019re borderline magnetic. All of this is totally fine, but why emphasize more realistic skating \u2013 something at the core of the game \u2013 if the ancillary happenings around the rink aren\u2019t also addressed?\n\nStill, for this seeming lack of logic, EA has gone out of its way to change its NHL series in pretty dynamic ways considering the developer has under a year to iterate on last year\u2019s product. For instance, the AI has adjusted with new attention paid to realistic skating physics. The claim is that EA spent more time on AI this year than in the three years prior combined. Players can now skate backwards more easily, cradle and protect the puck with greater emphasis, and choose from a growing number of neutral zone tendencies and overall play styles. Goaltenders are smarter and less inclined to let up easy goals, like one-timers and wrap-arounds. They\u2019re also more acrobatic than they\u2019ve ever been \u2013 mirroring the real game we know and love \u2013 and can even move individual limbs while sprawling and diving, bringing a Hasek-esque like look and feel to NHL 13\u2019s armored netminders.\n\nThis emphasis on presentation oozes into every facet of NHL 13 and isn\u2019t only evident when actually playing. Slow load times and some menu stuttering aside, the game looks beautiful. Games are presented as they would be on NBC Sports, replete with the familiar commentary of Gary Thorne and Bill Clemente. Ambient sounds of the arena, the crowd and the on-ice product are all expertly executed as well, supplementing the game\u2019s high visual fidelity. Animations are occasionally awkward (as they appear to be in all EA Sports products), but that has more to do with the constant number-crunching behind the scenes than anything else. NHL 13 is a sight to behold, as several editors who have watched me play the game in the IGN offices brought it upon themselves to let me know. It plays virtually identically online and off, sacrificing none of the bells of whistles regardless of who you want to play with and where.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are NHL 13\u2019s two new modes. One mode, NHL Moments Live, allows gamers to relive moments from hockey\u2019s past, challenging them to recreate the exact scenario given whether it\u2019s a goal in overtime with a specific player, an overall point count in a certain amount of time, or anything else you can think of. With most of the moments coming from this past season (and with more promised to be downloadable if this currently stalled season ever gets off the ground), these are events even novice hockey fans will remember and appreciate.\n\nBut as great as this idea is in premise \u2013 and as fun as it is to partake in \u2013 there are some puzzling choices that take away from its realism. This is especially true when considering some old moments, such as Gretzky\u2019s big game against the Flyers in 1981 or Doug Gilmour\u2019s overtime heroics against the Blues in the 1993 playoffs. In those games, players are cast in the role as Gretzky or Gilmour but are surrounded by the current roster of the Oilers and Maple Leafs, respectively, while playing against the current rosters of their opponents. It simply doesn\u2019t make any sense and was disappointing when I was expecting to see some familiar faces accompanying these great players, not guys who were, at best, in diapers when some of these events took place.\n\nThe other new, notable mode is called GM Connected. EA claims that GM Mode in its NHL series is the most popular offline mode, and I can understand why. It\u2019s totally engrossing if you\u2019re a hockey nerd. EA decided to leverage this popularity by bringing it online and accommodating up to 750 players in a single league. That\u2019s no typo: each league can consist of up to 750 real people from around the world, acting as commissioner, general managers and even players.\n\nGM Connected is an ambitious and bold mode, but one that needs time in the wild to truly appreciate. Gearing up for GM Connected as I reviewed it amounted to checking static screens and waiting for other players to act (I eventually set it so my CPU will make all in-game decisions). This mode can be truly robust and pay off big in the end, but it\u2019s impossible to say right now with the limited amount of players online, and the equally limited interaction it therefore affords. In other words, the jury\u2019s still out on GM Connected, but it\u2019s something worth meddling with, especially if you enjoy offline GM mode.\n\nCombining GM Connected and NHL Moments Live with the aforementioned offline season, GM and scrimmage modes, as well as the ability to play in one-off playoffs, tournaments, practices and more, NHL 13 gives you incredible bang for your buck. And yes, you can even create your own pro once again this year (or even play as some well-known veterans from the NHL\u2019s past) and grind through the junior and minor leagues as you ascend towards NHL glory.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s so much to do in NHL 13. And in a year looking less and less likely to provide the real thing, NHL 13 proves a mighty promising distraction.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with NHL 13. And if you\u2019re a hockey junky like me, chances are you will, too. For a full-price title, gamers get so much more than mere roster and tuner updates (which come for free and with regularity, by the way). You also get robust online and offline modes that could potentially keep you busy for hundreds of hours.\n\nNHL 13 may have some problems and inconsistencies, but they barely detract from the quality product EA Canada has put out this year, one that may just keep you warm on those cold, dark nights when you should be watching the real thing but are forced to play it on your console of choice instead.\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
